<h3 id="pgepubid00052"><a id="Relief_Vetera"/>The Relief of Vetera</h3>
<p><a id="IVchap31"/><span class="chapnum">31</span>Such was the course of events in Germany up to the date of the battle of <a id="id_2fnm316"/>Cremona.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn316" class="2fnnum pginternal">316</a> News of this arrived by letter from Antonius Primus, who enclosed a copy of Caecina's <a id="id_2fnm317"/>edict,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn317" class="2fnnum pginternal">317</a> and Alpinius <a id="id_2fnm318"/>Montanus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn318" class="2fnnum pginternal">318</a> who commanded one of the defeated auxiliary cohorts, came in person to confess that his party had been beaten. The troops were variously affected by the news. The Gallic auxiliaries, who had no feelings of affection or dislike to either party and served without sentiment, <a id="id_2page135"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="135"></a>promptly took the advice of their officers and deserted Vitellius. The veterans hesitated; under pressure from Flaccus and their officers they eventually took the oath of allegiance, but it was clear from their faces that their hearts were not in it, and while repeating the rest of the formula they boggled at the name of Vespasian, either muttering it under their breath or more often omitting it altogether. <a id="IVchap32"/><span class="chapnum">32</span>Their suspicions were further inflamed when Antonius' letter to Civilis was read out before the meeting; it seemed to address Civilis as a member of the Flavian party, and to argue hostility to the German army. The news was next brought to the camp at Gelduba, where it gave rise to the same comments and the same scenes. Montanus was sent to carry instructions to Civilis that he was to cease from hostilities and not to make war on Rome under a false pretext; if it was to help Vespasian that he had taken arms, he had now achieved his object. Civilis at first replied in guarded terms. Then, as he saw that Montanus was an impetuous person who would welcome a revolution, he began to complain of all the dangers he had endured in the service of Rome for the last twenty-five years. 'A fine reward I have received,' he cried, 'for all my labours—my brother's execution,<a id="id_2fnm319"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn319" class="2fnnum pginternal">319</a> my own imprisonment,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn319" class="2fnnum pginternal">319</a> and the bloodthirsty clamours of this army, from which I claim satisfaction by natural right since they have sought my destruction. As for you Trevirans and all the rest that have the souls of slaves, what reward do you hope <a id="id_2page136"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="136"></a>to gain for shedding your blood so often in the cause of Rome, except the thankless task of military service, endless taxation, and the rods and axes of these capricious tyrants? Look at me! I have only a single cohort under my command, and yet with the Canninefates and Batavi, a mere fraction of the Gallic peoples, I am engaged in destroying their great useless camp and besieging them with famine and the sword. In short, our venture will either end in freedom or, if we are beaten, we shall be no worse off than before.' Having thus inflamed Montanus he told him to take back a milder answer and dismissed him. On his return Montanus pretended that his errand had been fruitless, and said nothing about the rest of the interview: but it soon came to light.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap33"/><span class="chapnum">33</span>Retaining a portion of his force, Civilis sent the veteran cohorts with the most efficient of the German troops against Vocula and his <a id="id_2fnm320"/>army.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn320" class="2fnnum pginternal">320</a> He gave the command to Julius Maximus and his nephew Claudius Victor. After rushing the winter-quarters of a cavalry regiment at <a id="id_2fnm321"/>Asciburgium<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn321" class="2fnnum pginternal">321</a> on their way, they fell upon the Roman camp and so completely surprised it that Vocula had no time to address his army or to form it for battle. The only precaution he could take in the general panic was to mass the legionaries in the centre with the auxiliaries scattered on either flank. Our cavalry charged, but found the enemy in good order ready to receive them, and came flying back on to their own infantry. What followed was <a id="id_2page137"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="137"></a>more of a massacre than a battle. The Nervian cohorts, either from panic or treachery, left our flanks exposed; thus the legions had to bear the brunt. They had already lost their standards and were being cut down in the trenches, when a fresh reinforcement suddenly changed the fortune of the fight. Some Basque auxiliaries,<a id="id_2fnm322"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn322" class="2fnnum pginternal">322</a> originally levied by Galba, who had now been summoned to the rescue, on nearing the camp heard the sound of fighting, and while the enemy were occupied, came charging in on their rear. This caused more consternation than their numbers warranted, the enemy taking them for the whole Roman force, either from Novaesium or from Mainz. This mistake encouraged the Roman troops: their confidence in others brought confidence in themselves. The best of the Batavians, at least of their infantry, fell. The cavalry made off with the standards and prisoners taken in the earlier stage of the battle. Though our losses that day were numerically larger, they were unimportant, whereas the Germans lost their best troops.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap34"/><span class="chapnum">34</span>On both sides the generals deserved defeat, and failed to make good use of their success. Their fault was the same. Had Civilis furnished the attacking column with more troops, they could never have been surrounded by such a small force, and having stormed the camp would have destroyed it. Vocula, on the other <a id="id_2page138"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="138"></a>hand, had not even set scouts to warn him of the enemy's approach, and consequently no sooner sallied out than he was beaten. Then, when he had won the victory, he showed great lack of confidence, and wasted day after day before moving against the enemy. If he had made haste to follow up his success and struck at the enemy at once, he might have raised the siege of Vetera at one blow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Civilis had been playing upon the feelings of the besieged by pretending that the Romans had been defeated and success had favoured his arms. The captured standards and colours were carried round the walls and the prisoners also displayed. One of these did a famous deed of heroism. Shouting at the top of his voice, he revealed the truth. The Germans at once struck him dead, which only served to confirm his information. Soon, too, the besieged saw signs of harried fields and the smoke of burning farms, and began to realize that a victorious army was approaching. When he was in sight of the camp Vocula ordered his men to plant the standards and construct a trench and rampart round them: they were to deposit all their baggage there and fight unencumbered. This made them shout at the general to give them the signal; and they had learnt to use threats too. Without even taking time to form their line they started the battle, all tired as they were, and in disorder. Civilis was ready waiting for them, trusting quite as much to their mistakes as to the merits of his own men. The Romans fought with varying fortune. All the most mutinous <a id="id_2page139"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="139"></a>proved cowards: some, however, remembered their recent victory and stuck to their places, cutting down the enemy, and encouraging themselves and their neighbours. When the battle was thus renewed, they waved their hands and signalled to the besieged not to lose their opportunity. These were watching all that happened from the walls, and now came bursting out at every gate. It chanced that at this point Civilis' horse fell and threw him; both armies believed the rumour that he had been wounded and killed. This caused immense consternation to his army and immense encouragement to ours. However, Vocula failed to pursue them when they fled, and merely set about strengthening the rampart and turrets, apparently in fear of another blockade. His frequent failure to make use of his victory gives colour to the suspicion that he preferred <a id="id_2fnm323"/>war.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn323" class="2fnnum pginternal">323</a></p>
<p><a id="IVchap35"/><span class="chapnum">35</span>What chiefly distressed our troops was the lack of supplies. The baggage-train of the legions was sent to Novaesium with a crowd of non-combatants to fetch provisions thence by land, the enemy being now masters of the river. The first convoy got through <a id="id_2page140"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="140"></a>safely, while Civilis was recovering from his fall. But when he heard that a second foraging-party had been sent to Novaesium under guard of several cohorts, and that they were proceeding on their way with their arms piled in the wagons as if it was a time of perfect peace, few keeping to the standards and all wandering at will, he sent some men forward to hold the bridges and any places where the road was narrow, and then formed up and attacked. The battle was fought on a long straggling line, and the issue was still doubtful when nightfall broke it off. The cohorts made their way through to Gelduba, where the camp remained as it was,<a id="id_2fnm324"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn324" class="2fnnum pginternal">324</a> garrisoned by the soldiers who had been left behind there. It was obvious what dangers the convoy would have to face on the return journey; they would be heavily laden and had already lost their nerve. <a id="id_2fnm325"/>Vocula<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn325" class="2fnnum pginternal">325</a> accordingly added to his force a thousand picked men from the Fifth and Fifteenth legions who had been at Vetera during the siege, all tough soldiers with a grievance against their generals. Against his orders, more than the thousand started with him, openly complaining on the march that they would not put up with famine and the treachery of their generals any longer. On the other hand, those who stayed behind grumbled that they were left to their fate now that part of the garrison had been removed. Thus there was a double mutiny, one party <a id="id_2page141"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="141"></a>calling Vocula back, the others refusing to return to camp.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap36"/><span class="chapnum">36</span>Meanwhile Civilis laid siege to Vetera. Vocula retired to Gelduba, and thence to Novaesium, shortly afterwards winning a cavalry skirmish just outside Novaesium. The Roman soldiers, however, alike in success and in failure, were as eager as ever to make an end of their generals. Now that their numbers were swelled by the arrival of the detachments from the Fifth and the <a id="id_2fnm326"/>Fifteenth<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn326" class="2fnnum pginternal">326</a> they demanded their donative, having learnt that money had arrived from Vitellius. Without further delay Flaccus gave it to them in Vespasian's name, and this did more than anything else to promote mutiny. They indulged in wild dissipation and met every night in drinking-parties, at which they revived their old grudge against Hordeonius Flaccus. None of the officers ventured to interfere with them—the darkness somehow obscured their sense of duty—and at last they dragged Flaccus out of bed and murdered him. They were preparing to do the same with Vocula, but he narrowly escaped in the darkness, disguised as a slave. <a id="IVchap37"/><span class="chapnum">37</span>When the excitement subsided, their fears returned, and they sent letters round by centurions to all the Gallic communities, asking for reinforcements and money for the soldiers' pay.</p>
<p>Without a leader a mob is always rash, timorous, and inactive. On the approach of Civilis they hurriedly snatched up their arms, and then immediately dropped them and took to flight. Misfortune now bred disunion, <a id="id_2page142"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="142"></a>and the army of the Upper <a id="id_2fnm327"/>Rhine<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn327" class="2fnnum pginternal">327</a> dissociated itself from the rest. However, they set up the statues of Vitellius again in the camp and in the neighbouring Belgic villages, although by now Vitellius was <a id="id_2fnm328"/>dead.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn328" class="2fnnum pginternal">328</a> Soon the soldiers of the First, Fourth, and Twenty-second repented of their folly and rejoined Vocula. He made them take a second oath of allegiance to Vespasian and led them off to raise the siege of Mainz. The besieging army, a combined force of <a id="id_2fnm329"/>Chatti,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn329" class="2fnnum pginternal">329</a> Usipi, and <a id="id_2fnm330"/>Mattiaci,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn330" class="2fnnum pginternal">330</a> had already retired, having got sufficient loot and suffered some loss. Our troops surprised them while they were scattered along the road, and immediately attacked. Moreover, the Treviri had built a rampart and breastwork all along their frontier and fought the Germans again and again with heavy loss to both sides. Before long, however, they rebelled, and thus sullied their great services to the Roman people.</p>

He has to confess that a military motive for Vocula's inaction is hard to find. Tacitus, feeling the same, offers a merely human motive. Soldiers of fortune often prefer war to final victory, and in these days the dangers of peace were only equalled by its ennui. Besides, Tacitus' explanation lends itself to an epigram which he would doubtless not have exchanged for the tedium of tactical truth.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00053"><a id="Under_Vespasian"/>Rome and the Empire under Vespasian</h3>
<p><a id="IVchap38"/><span class="chapnum">38</span>During these events Vespasian took up his second consulship and Titus his first, both in <a id="id_2fnm331"/>absence.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn331" class="2fnnum pginternal">331</a> Rome was depressed and beset by manifold anxieties. Apart <a id="id_2page143"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="143"></a>from the real miseries of the moment, it was plunged into a groundless panic on the rumour of a rebellion in Africa, where Lucius Piso was supposed to be plotting a revolution. Piso, who was governor of the province, was far from being a firebrand. But the severity of the winter delayed the corn-ships, and the common people, accustomed to buy their bread day by day, whose interest in politics was confined to the corn-supply, soon began to believe their fears that the coast of Africa was being blockaded and supplies withheld. The Vitellians, who were still under the sway of party spirit, fostered this rumour, and even the victorious party were not entirely displeased at it, for none of their victories in the civil war had satisfied their greed, and even foreign wars fell far short of their ambition.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap39"/><span class="chapnum">39</span>On the first of January the senate was convened by the Urban <a id="id_2fnm332"/>Praetor,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn332" class="2fnnum pginternal">332</a> Julius Frontinus, and passed votes of thanks and congratulation to the generals, armies, and foreign <a id="id_2fnm333"/>princes.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn333" class="2fnnum pginternal">333</a> Tettius <a id="id_2fnm334"/>Julianus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn334" class="2fnnum pginternal">334</a> who had left his legion when it went over to Vespasian, was deprived of his praetorship, which was conferred upon Plotius <a id="id_2fnm335"/>Grypus.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn335" class="2fnnum pginternal">335</a> <a id="id_2fnm336"/>Hormus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn336" class="2fnnum pginternal">336</a> was raised to equestrian rank. Frontinus then resigned his praetorship and Caesar Domitian succeeded him. His name now stood at the head of all dispatches and edicts, but the real authority <a id="id_2page144"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="144"></a>lay with Mucianus, although Domitian, following the promptings of his friends and of his own desires, frequently asserted his independence. But Mucianus' chief cause of anxiety lay in Antonius Primus and Arrius Varus. The fame of their exploits was still fresh; the soldiers worshipped them; and they were popular in Rome, because they had used no violence off the field of battle. It was even hinted that Antonius had urged Crassus <a id="id_2fnm337"/>Scribonianus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn337" class="2fnnum pginternal">337</a> to seize the throne. He was a man who owed his distinction to famous ancestors and to his brother's memory, and Antonius could promise him adequate support for a conspiracy. However, Scribonianus refused. He had a terror of all risks, and would hardly have been seduced even by the certainty of success. Being unable to crush Antonius openly, Mucianus showered compliments on him in the senate and embarrassed him with promises, hinting at the governorship of Nearer Spain, which the departure of Cluvius <a id="id_2fnm338"/>Rufus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn338" class="2fnnum pginternal">338</a> had left vacant. Meanwhile he lavished military commands on Antonius' friends. Then, having filled his empty head with ambitious hopes, he destroyed his influence at one stroke by moving the Seventh <a id="id_2fnm339"/>legion,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn339" class="2fnnum pginternal">339</a> which was passionately attached to Antonius, into winter-quarters. The Third, who were similarly devoted to Arrius Varus, <a id="id_2page145"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="145"></a>were sent back to <a id="id_2fnm340"/>Syria,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn340" class="2fnnum pginternal">340</a> and part of the army was taken out to the war in Germany. Thus, on the removal of the disturbing factors, the city could resume its normal life under the old regime of law and civil government.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap40"/><span class="chapnum">40</span>On the day of his first appearance in the senate Domitian spoke a few moderate sentences regretting the absence of his father and brother. His behaviour was most proper, and, as his character was still an unknown quantity, his blushes were taken for signs of modesty.<a id="id_2fnm341"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn341" class="2fnnum pginternal">341</a> He moved from the chair that all Galba's honours should be restored, to which Curtius Montanus proposed an amendment that some respect should also be paid to the memory of Piso. The senate approved both proposals, though nothing was done about Piso. Next, various commissions were appointed by lot to restore the spoils of war to the owners; to examine and affix the bronze tablets of laws, which in course of time had dropped off the walls; to revise the list of public holidays, which in these days of flattery had been disgracefully tampered with; and to introduce some economy into public expenditure. Tettius Julianus was restored to his praetorship as soon as it was discovered that he had taken refuge with Vespasian: but Grypus was allowed to retain his <a id="id_2fnm342"/>rank.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn342" class="2fnnum pginternal">342</a> It was then decided to resume the hearing of the case of<a id="id_2page146"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="146"></a> Musonius Rufus against Publius <a id="id_2fnm343"/>Celer<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn343" class="2fnnum pginternal">343</a> Publius was convicted and the shade of Soranus satisfied. This strict verdict made the day memorable in the annals of Rome, and credit was also due to private enterprise, for everybody felt that Musonius had done his duty in bringing the action. On the other hand, Demetrius, a professor of Cynic philosophy, earned discredit for defending an obvious <a id="id_2fnm344"/>criminal<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn344" class="2fnnum pginternal">344</a> more for ostentatious motives than from honest conviction. As for Publius, courage and fluency alike failed him at the critical moment. This trial was the signal for further reprisals against prosecutors. Junius <a id="id_2fnm345"/>Mauricus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn345" class="2fnnum pginternal">345</a> accordingly petitioned Domitian that the senate might be allowed access to the minutes of the imperial cabinet, in order to find out who had applied for leave to bring a prosecution and against whom. The answer was that on such a question as this the emperor must be consulted. <a id="IVchap41"/><span class="chapnum">41</span>Accordingly, at the instigation of its leading members, the senate framed an oath in these words, 'I call heaven to witness that I have never countenanced any action prejudicial to any man's civil status, nor have I derived any profit or any office from the misfortune of any Roman citizen.' The magistrates vied with each other in their haste to take this oath, and the other members <a id="id_2page147"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="147"></a>did the same, when called upon to speak. Those who had a guilty conscience were alarmed, and managed to alter the wording of the oath by various devices. The house meanwhile applauded every sign of scruple, and protested against each case of perjury. This kind of informal censure fell most severely on Sariolenus Vocula, Nonius Attianus, and Cestius Severus, who were notorious as habitual informers under Nero. Against Sariolenus there was also a fresh charge of having continued his practices with Vitellius. The members went on shaking their fists at him until he left the house. They next turned on Paccius Africanus, trying to hound him out in the same way. He was supposed to have suggested to Nero the murder of the two brothers <a id="id_2fnm346"/>Scribonius,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn346" class="2fnnum pginternal">346</a> who were famous for their friendship and their wealth. Africanus dared not admit his guilt, though he could not very well deny it. So he swung round on Vibius Crispus,<a id="id_2fnm347"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn347" class="2fnnum pginternal">347</a> who was pestering him with questions, and tried to turn the tables by implicating him in the charges which he could not rebut, thus shifting the odium on to his accomplice.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap42"/><span class="chapnum">42</span>On this occasion Vipstanus <a id="id_2fnm348"/>Messala<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn348" class="2fnnum pginternal">348</a> gained a great reputation, both for dutiful affection and for eloquence, by venturing to intercede for his brother Aquilius <a id="id_2fnm349"/>Regulus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn349" class="2fnnum pginternal">349</a> although he had not attained the senatorial <a id="id_2fnm350"/>age.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn350" class="2fnnum pginternal">350</a> Regulus had fallen into great disfavour for having <a id="id_2page148"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="148"></a>brought about the ruin of the noble families of the Crassi and of Orfitus. It was supposed that, though quite a young man, he had voluntarily undertaken the prosecution, not to escape any danger which was threatening him, but from purely ambitious motives. Crassus' wife, Sulpicia Praetextata, and his four sons were anxious to secure revenge if the senate would grant a trial. Messala therefore made no attempt to defend the case or the accused, but tried to shelter his brother, and had already won over some of the senators. Curtius Montanus now attacked him in a savage speech, and even went so far as to charge Regulus with having given money to Piso's murderer after Galba's death, and with having bitten Piso's <a id="id_2fnm351"/>head.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn351" class="2fnnum pginternal">351</a> 'That,' said he, 'Nero certainly did not compel you to do. You purchased neither position nor safety by that savage piece of cruelty. We may put up with the pleas of those wretches who prefer to ruin others rather than endanger their own lives. But your father's banishment had guaranteed your security. His property had been divided amongst his <a id="id_2fnm352"/>creditors.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn352" class="2fnnum pginternal">352</a> You were not of an age to stand for office. Nero had nothing either to hope or to fear from you. Your talents were as yet untried and you had never exerted them in any man's defence, yet your lust for blood, your insatiable ambition, led you to stain your young hands in the blood of Rome's nobility. At one swoop <a id="id_2page149"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="149"></a>you caused the ruin of innocent youths, of old and distinguished statesmen, of high-born ladies; and out of the country's disaster you secured for yourself the spoils of two ex-consuls,<a id="id_2fnm353"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn353" class="2fnnum pginternal">353</a> stuffed seven million sesterces into your purse, and shone with the reflected glory of a priesthood. You would blame Nero's lack of enterprise because he took one household at a time, thus causing unnecessary fatigue to himself and his informers, when he might have ruined the whole senate at a single word. Why, gentlemen, you must indeed keep and preserve to yourselves a counsellor of such ready resource. Let each generation have its good examples: and as our old men follow Eprius Marcellus or Vibius Crispus, let the rising generation emulate Regulus. Villainy finds followers even when it fails. What if it flourish and prosper? If we hesitate to touch a mere ex-quaestor, shall we be any bolder when he has been praetor and consul? Or do you suppose that the race of tyrants came to an end in Nero? That is what the people believed who outlived Tiberius or Caligula, and meanwhile there arose one more infamous and more bloody <a id="id_2fnm354"/>still.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn354" class="2fnnum pginternal">354</a> We are not afraid of Vespasian. We trust his years and his natural moderation. But a good precedent outlives a good sovereign. Gentlemen, we are growing effete: we are no longer that senate which, after Nero had been killed, clamoured for the punishment of all informers and their menials according to our ancestors'<a id="id_2page150"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="150"></a> rigorous prescription. The best chance comes on the day after the death of a bad emperor.'</p>
<p><a id="IVchap43"/><span class="chapnum">43</span>The senate listened to Montanus's speech with such sympathy that Helvidius began to hope that it might be possible to get a verdict even against Marcellus. Beginning with a eulogy of Cluvius Rufus, who, though quite as rich and as eloquent as Marcellus, had never brought any one into trouble under Nero, he went on to attack Marcellus, both by contrasting him with Rufus and by pressing home the charge against him. Feeling that the house was warming to this rhetoric, Marcellus got up as though to leave, exclaiming, 'I am off, Helvidius: I leave you your senate: you can tyrannize over it under Caesar's nose.' Vibius Crispus followed Marcellus, and, though both were angry, their expressions were very different. Marcellus marched out with flashing eyes, Crispus with a smile on his face. Eventually their friends went and brought them back. Thus the struggle grew more and more heated between a well-meaning majority and a small but powerful minority; and since they were both animated by irreconcilable hatred, the day was spent in vain recriminations.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap44"/><span class="chapnum">44</span>At the next sitting Domitian opened by recommending them to forget their grievances and grudges and the unavoidable exigences of the recent past. Mucianus then at great length moved a motion in favour of the prosecutors, issuing a mild warning, almost in terms of entreaty, to those who wanted to revive actions which had been begun and dropped.<a id="id_2page151"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="151"></a> Seeing that their attempt at independence was being thwarted, the senate gave it up. However, that it might not seem as if the senate's opinion had been flouted and complete impunity granted for all crimes committed under Nero, Mucianus forced Octavius Sagitta and Antistius Sosianus, who had returned from exile, to go back to the islands to which they had been confined. Octavius had committed adultery with Pontia Postumina, and, on her refusal to marry him, had murdered her in a fit of jealous fury. Sosianus was an unprincipled scoundrel who had been the ruin of <a id="id_2fnm355"/>many.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn355" class="2fnnum pginternal">355</a> The senate had found them both guilty, and passed a heavy sentence of exile, nor had their penalty been remitted, although others were allowed to return. However, this failed to allay the ill-feeling against Mucianus, for Sosianus and Sagitta, whether they returned or not, were of no importance, whereas people were afraid of the professional prosecutors, who were men of wealth and ability and experts in crime.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap45"/><span class="chapnum">45</span>Unanimity was gradually restored in the senate by the holding of a trial according to ancient precedent, before a court of the whole house. A senator named Manlius Patruitus complained that he had been beaten before a mob of people in the colony of Siena by order of the local magistrates. Nor had the affront stopped there. They had held a mock funeral before his eyes, and had accompanied their dirges and lamentations with gross insults levelled at the whole senate. The <a id="id_2page152"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="152"></a>accused were summoned; their case was tried; they were convicted and punished. A further decree of the senate was passed admonishing the commons of Siena to pay more respect to the laws. About the same time Antonius Flamma was prosecuted by Cyrene for extortion, and exiled for the inhumanity of his conduct.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap46"/><span class="chapnum">46</span>Meanwhile, a mutiny almost broke out among the soldiers. The men who had been discharged by <a id="id_2fnm356"/>Vitellius<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn356" class="2fnnum pginternal">356</a> came together again in support of Vespasian, and demanded re-admission. They were joined by the selected legionaries who had also been led to hope for service in the Guards, and they now demanded the pay they had been promised. Even the <a id="id_2fnm357"/>Vitellians<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn357" class="2fnnum pginternal">357</a> alone could not have been dispersed without serious bloodshed, but it would require immense sums of money to retain the services of such a large number of men. Mucianus accordingly entered the barracks to make a careful estimate of each man's term of service. He formed up the victorious troops with their own arms and distinctive decorations, each company a few paces from the next. Then the Vitellians who had surrendered, as we have described, at <a id="id_2fnm358"/>Bovillae,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn358" class="2fnnum pginternal">358</a> and all the other soldiers who had been hunted down in the city and its neighbourhood, were marched out almost entirely without arms or uniforms. Mucianus then had them <a id="id_2page153"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="153"></a>sorted out, and drew up in separate corps the troops of the German army, of the British army, and of any others that were in Rome. Their first glance at the scene astounded them. Facing them they saw what looked like a fighting front bristling with weapons, while they were caught in a trap, defenceless and foul with dirt. As soon as they began to be sorted out a panic seized them. The German troops in particular were terrified at their isolation, and felt they were being told off for slaughter. They embraced their comrades and clung upon their necks, asking for one last kiss, begging not to be left alone, crying out, 'Our cause is the same as yours, why should our fate be different?' They appealed now to Mucianus, now to the absent emperor, and lastly to the powers of Heaven, until Mucianus came to the rescue of their imaginary terrors by calling them all 'sworn servants of one emperor', for he found that the victorious army was joining in and seconding their tears with cheering. On that day the matter ended there. A few days later, when Domitian addressed them, they received him with renewed confidence, refused his offer of lands, and begged for enlistment and their pay instead. This was only a petition, but one that could not be refused: so they were admitted to the Guards. Subsequently, those who had grown old and completed the regular term of <a id="id_2fnm359"/>service<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn359" class="2fnnum pginternal">359</a> were honourably discharged. Others were dismissed for misbehaviour, but one by one at <a id="id_2page154"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="154"></a>different times, which is always the safest method of weakening any kind of conspiracy.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap47"/><span class="chapnum">47</span>To return to the senate; a bill was now passed that a loan of sixty million sesterces should be raised from private individuals and administered by Pompeius Silvanus. This may have been a financial necessity, or they may have wanted it to seem so. At any rate the necessity soon ceased to exist, or else they gave up the pretence. Domitian then carried a proposal that the consulships conferred by Vitellius should be cancelled, and that a state funeral should be held in honour of Flavius <a id="id_2fnm360"/>Sabinus.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn360" class="2fnnum pginternal">360</a> Both proposals are striking evidence of the fickleness of human fortune, which so often makes the first last and the last first.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap48"/><span class="chapnum">48</span>It was about this time that Lucius <a id="id_2fnm361"/>Piso,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn361" class="2fnnum pginternal">361</a> the pro-consul of Africa, was killed. To give a true explanation of this murder we must go back and take a brief survey of certain matters which are closely connected with the reasons for such crimes. Under the sainted Augustus and Tiberius the pro-consul of Africa had in his command one legion and some auxiliaries with which to guard the frontier of the <a id="id_2fnm362"/>empire.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn362" class="2fnnum pginternal">362</a> Caligula, who was restless by nature and harboured suspicions <a id="id_2page155"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="155"></a>of the then pro-consul, Marcus Silanus, withdrew the legion from his command and put it under a legate whom he sent out for the purpose. As each had an equal amount of patronage and their functions overlapped, Caligula thus caused a state of friction which was further aggravated by regrettable quarrels. The greater permanence of his <a id="id_2fnm363"/>tenure<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn363" class="2fnnum pginternal">363</a> gradually strengthened the legate's position, and perhaps an inferior is always anxious to vie with his betters. The most eminent governors, on the other hand, were more careful of their comfort than of their authority.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap49"/><span class="chapnum">49</span>At the present time the legion in Africa was commanded by Valerius <a id="id_2fnm364"/>Festus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn364" class="2fnnum pginternal">364</a> an extravagant young man, immoderately ambitious, whose kinship with Vitellius had given him some anxiety. He had frequent interviews with Piso, and it is impossible to tell whether he tempted Piso to rebel or resisted Piso's temptations. No one was present at their interviews, which were held in private, and after Piso's death most people were inclined to sympathize with his murderer. Beyond doubt the province and the garrison were unfavourable to Vespasian. Besides, some of the Vitellian refugees from Rome pointed out to Piso that the Gallic provinces were wavering. Germany was ready to rebel, and he himself was in danger; 'and,' they added, 'if you earn suspicion in peace your safest <a id="id_2page156"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="156"></a>course is war.' Meanwhile, Claudius Sagitta, who commanded Petra's Horse,<a id="id_2fnm365"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn365" class="2fnnum pginternal">365</a> made a good crossing and outstripped the centurion Papirius, who had been sent out by Mucianus and was commissioned, so Sagitta affirmed, to assassinate Piso. Sagitta further stated that Galerianus,<a id="id_2fnm366"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn366" class="2fnnum pginternal">366</a> Piso's cousin and son-in-law, had already been murdered, and told him that while his one hope lay in taking a bold step, there were two courses open to him: he might either take up arms on the spot, or he might prefer to sail to Gaul and offer to lead the Vitellian armies. This made no impression on Piso. When the centurion whom Mucianus had sent arrived at the gates of Carthage, he kept on shouting all sorts of congratulations to Piso on becoming emperor. The people he met, who were astounded at this unexpected miracle, were instructed to take up the cry. With a crowd's usual credulity, they rushed into the forum calling on Piso to appear, and as they had a passion for flattery and took no interest in the truth, they proceeded to fill the whole place with a confused noise of cheering. Piso, however, either at a hint from Sagitta, or from his natural good sense, would not show himself in public or give way to the excitement of the crowd. He examined the centurion, and learnt that his object was to trump up a charge against him and then kill <a id="id_2fnm367"/>him.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn367" class="2fnnum pginternal">367</a> He accordingly had the man executed more from indignation against <a id="id_2page157"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="157"></a>the assassin than in any hope of saving his life; for he found that the man had been one of the murderers of Clodius <a id="id_2fnm368"/>Macer,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn368" class="2fnnum pginternal">368</a> and after staining his hand in the blood of a military officer was now proposing to turn it against a civil governor. Piso then reprimanded the Carthaginians in an edict which clearly showed his anxiety, and refrained from performing even the routine of his office, shutting himself up in his house, for fear that he might by accident provide some pretext for further demonstrations.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap50"/><span class="chapnum">50</span>When the news of the popular excitement and the centurion's execution reached the ears of Festus, considerably exaggerated and with the usual admixture of falsehood, he at once sent off a party of horsemen to murder Piso. Riding at full speed, they reached the governor's house in the twilight of early dawn and broke in with drawn swords. As Festus had mainly chosen Carthaginian auxiliaries and Moors to do the murder, most of them did not know Piso by sight. However, near his bedroom they happened on a slave and asked him where Piso was and what he looked like. In answer the slave told them a heroic lie and said he was Piso, whereupon they immediately cut him down. However, Piso himself was killed very soon after, for there was one man among them who knew him, and that was Baebius Massa, one of the imperial agents in Africa, who was already a danger to all the best men in Rome. His name will recur again and again in this narrative, as one of the causes of the troubles <a id="id_2page158"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="158"></a>which beset us later <a id="id_2fnm369"/>on.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn369" class="2fnnum pginternal">369</a> Festus had been waiting at <a id="id_2fnm370"/>Adrumetum<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn370" class="2fnnum pginternal">370</a> to see how things went, and he now hastened to rejoin his legion. He had the camp-prefect, Caetronius Pisanus, put in irons, alleging that he was one of Piso's accomplices, though his real motive was personal dislike. He then punished some of the soldiers and centurions and rewarded others; in neither case for their deserts, but because he wanted it to be thought that he had stamped out a war. His next task was to settle the differences between Oea and Lepcis.<a id="id_2fnm371"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn371" class="2fnnum pginternal">371</a> These had had a trivial origin in thefts of fruit and cattle by the peasants, but they were now trying to settle them in open warfare. Oea, being inferior in numbers, had called in the aid of the <a id="id_2fnm372"/>Garamantes,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn372" class="2fnnum pginternal">372</a> an invincible tribe, who were always a fruitful source of damage to their neighbours. Thus the people of Lepcis were in great straits. Their fields had been wasted far and wide, and they had fled in terror under shelter of their walls, when the Roman auxiliaries, both horse and foot, arrived on the scene. They routed the Garamantes and recovered all the booty, except what the nomads had already sold among the inaccessible hut-settlements of the far interior.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap51"/><span class="chapnum">51</span>After the battle of Cremona and the arrival of good <a id="id_2page159"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="159"></a>news from every quarter, Vespasian now heard of Vitellius' death. A large number of people of all classes, who were as lucky as they were adventurous, successfully braved the winter seas on purpose to bring him the <a id="id_2fnm373"/>news.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn373" class="2fnnum pginternal">373</a> There also arrived envoys from King Vologaesus offering the services of forty thousand Parthian <a id="id_2fnm374"/>cavalry.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn374" class="2fnnum pginternal">374</a> It was, indeed, a proud and fortunate situation to be courted with such splendid offers of assistance, and to need none of them. Vologaesus was duly thanked and instructed to send his envoys to the senate and to understand that peace had been made. Vespasian now devoted his attention to the affairs of Italy and the Capitol, and received an unfavourable report of Domitian, who seemed to be trespassing beyond the natural sphere of an emperor's youthful son. He accordingly handed over the flower of his army to Titus, who was to finish off the war with the <a id="id_2fnm375"/>Jews.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn375" class="2fnnum pginternal">375</a></p>
<p><a id="IVchap52"/><span class="chapnum">52</span>It is said that before his departure Titus had a long talk with his father and begged him not to be rash and lose his temper at these incriminating reports, but to meet his son in a forgiving and unprejudiced spirit, 'Neither legions nor fleets,' he is reported to have said, 'are such sure bulwarks of the throne as a number of children. Time, chance and often, too, ambition and misunderstanding weaken, alienate or extinguish friendship: a man's own blood cannot be severed from him; and above all is this the case with <a id="id_2page160"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="160"></a>a sovereign, for, while others enjoy his good fortune, his misfortunes only concern his nearest kin. Nor again are brothers likely to remain good friends unless their father sets them an example.' These words had the effect of making Vespasian rather delighted at Titus' goodness of heart than inclined to forgive Domitian. 'You may ease your mind,' he said to Titus, 'It is now your duty to increase the prestige of Rome on the field: I will concern myself with peace at home.' Though the weather was still very rough, Vespasian at once launched his fastest corn-ships with a full cargo. For the city was on the verge of <a id="id_2fnm376"/>famine.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn376" class="2fnnum pginternal">376</a> Indeed, there were not supplies for more than ten days in the public granaries at the moment when Vespasian's convoy brought relief.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap53"/><span class="chapnum">53</span>The task of restoring the <a id="id_2fnm377"/>Capitol<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn377" class="2fnnum pginternal">377</a> was entrusted to Lucius Vestinus, who, though only a knight, yet in reputation and influence could rank with the highest. He summoned all the soothsayers,<a id="id_2fnm378"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn378" class="2fnnum pginternal">378</a> and they recommended that the ruins of the former temple should be carried away to the <a id="id_2fnm379"/>marshes<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn379" class="2fnnum pginternal">379</a> and a new temple erected on the same site: the gods were unwilling, they said, that the original form of the building should be changed. On the 21st of June, a day of bright sun<a id="id_2page161"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="161"></a>shine, the whole consecrated area of the temple was decorated with chaplets and garlands. In marched soldiers, all men with names of good omen, carrying branches of lucky trees:<a id="id_2fnm380"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn380" class="2fnnum pginternal">380</a> then came the Vestal Virgins accompanied by boys and girls, each of whom had father and mother <a id="id_2fnm381"/>alive,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn381" class="2fnnum pginternal">381</a> and they cleansed it all by sprinkling fresh water from a spring or river.<a id="id_2fnm382"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn382" class="2fnnum pginternal">382</a> Next, while the high priest, Plautius Aelianus, dictated the proper formulae, Helvidius Priscus, the praetor, first consecrated the site by a solemn <a id="id_2fnm383"/>sacrifice<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn383" class="2fnnum pginternal">383</a> of a pig, a sheep and an ox, and then duly offering the entrails on an altar of turf, he prayed to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, as the guardian deities of the empire, to prosper the enterprise, and by divine grace to bring to completion this house of theirs which human piety had here begun. He then took hold of the chaplets to which the ropes holding the foundation-stone were attached. At the same moment the other magistrates and the priests and senators and knights and large numbers of the populace in joyous excitement with one great effort dragged the huge stone into its place. On every side gifts of gold and silver were flung into the foundations, and <a id="id_2page162"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="162"></a>blocks of virgin ore unscathed by any furnace, just as they had come from the womb of the earth. For the soothsayers had given out that the building must not be desecrated by the use of stone or gold that had been put to any other purpose. The height of the roof was raised. This was the only change that religious scruples would allow, and it was felt to be the only point in which the former temple lacked grandeur.</p>
