<h3 id="pgepubid00014"><a id="Galbas_Measures_of_Precaution"/>Galba's Measures of Precaution</h3>
<p>Reports of the German rebellion grew daily more insistent and the public was always ready to believe any news, provided it was bad. Accordingly the senate decided that a commission must be sent to the army in Germany. It was discussed in private whether Piso should go himself to add dignity to the commission, since he could carry the authority of the emperor, while the others represented the senate. It was also proposed to send Laco, the prefect of the Guards, but he objected. The senate had allowed Galba to nominate the commissioners and he showed the most miserable indecision, now nominating members, now excusing them, now making exchanges, yielding always to pressure from people who wanted to go or to stay at home according as they were determined by their hopes or their fears. <a id="Ichap20"/><span class="chapnum">20</span>The next question was one of finance. After investigating all possible sources it seemed most reasonable to recover the revenue from those quarters where the cause of the deficit lay. Nero had squandered in lavish presents two thousand two hundred million <a id="id_1fnm45"/>sesterces.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn45" class="fnnum pginternal">45</a> Galba gave instructions that these monies should be recovered from <a id="id_1page38"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="38"></a>the individual recipients, leaving each a tithe of their original gift. However, in each case there was scarcely a tenth part left, for these worthless spendthrifts had run through Nero's money as freely as they had squandered their own: they had no real property or capital left, nothing but the apparatus of their luxury. Thirty of the knights were entrusted with the duty of recovering the money. This commission, for which there was no precedent, proved vastly unpopular owing to the scope of its authority, and the large number of the victims. Every quarter seemed beset with sales and brokers and lawsuits. And yet lively satisfaction was caused by the discovery that the beneficiaries of Nero's bounty were as poor as the victims of his greed.</p>
<p>At this time several officers were cashiered, Antonius Taurus and Antonius Naso of the Guards, Aemilius Pacensis of the City Garrison, and Julius Fronto of the <a id="id_1fnm46"/>Police.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn46" class="fnnum pginternal">46</a> However, this proved no remedy. The others only began to feel alarmed, thinking that Galba's craft and timidity had sacrificed a few, while his suspicions rested on them all.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00015"><a id="The_Rise_of_Otho"/>The Rise of Otho</h3>
<p><a id="Ichap21"/><span class="chapnum">21</span>Meanwhile Otho had nothing to hope from a peaceful settlement: all his plans demanded a disturbance. Many motives spurred him on: his extravagance would have ruined a prince, and his poverty have perplexed a private person: he was angry with Galba and jealous <a id="id_1page39"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="39"></a>of Piso. He also alleged fears for his safety, by way of whetting his ambition. 'I proved a nuisance to Nero,' he would say, 'and can scarcely expect the compliment of a second exile to Lusitania.<a id="id_1fnm47"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn47" class="fnnum pginternal">47</a> Besides, monarchs always hate and suspect the man who is mentioned as "next to the throne". This was what did me harm with the old emperor, and it will weigh still more with the youthful Piso, who is naturally savage and has been exasperated by a long period of exile. It would be easy to kill me. I must do and dare while Galba's authority is on the wane and Piso's not yet established. These times of change suit big enterprises; inaction is more deadly than daring; there is no call for delay. Death is the natural end for all alike, and the only difference is between fame and oblivion afterwards. Seeing that the same end awaits the innocent and the guilty, a man of spirit should at least deserve his fate.'</p>
<p><a id="Ichap22"/><span class="chapnum">22</span>Otho's character was by no means so effeminate as his person. His intimate freedmen and slaves, who were allowed a licence unusual in private households, dangled before him the baits for which he was greedy: the luxuries of Nero's Court, the marriages he could make, the adulteries he could commit, and all the other imperial pleasures. They were his, they pointed out, if he would bestir himself; it was shameful to lie quiet and leave them to others. He was also incited by the astrologers, who declared that their study of the stars pointed to great changes and a year <a id="id_1page40"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="40"></a>of glory for Otho. Creatures of this class always deceive the ambitious, though those in power distrust them. Probably we shall go on for ever proscribing them and keeping them by <a id="id_1fnm48"/>us.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn48" class="fnnum pginternal">48</a> <a id="id_1fnm49"/>Poppaea<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn49" class="fnnum pginternal">49</a> had always had her boudoir full of these astrologers, the worst kind of outfit for a royal ménage. One of them, called Ptolemy, had gone with Otho to <a id="id_1fnm50"/>Spain<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn50" class="fnnum pginternal">50</a> and foretold that he would outlive Nero. This came true and Otho believed in him. He now based his vague conjectures on the computations of Galba's age and Otho's youth, and persuaded him that he would ascend the throne. But, though the man had no real skill, Otho accepted the prophecy as if it was the finger of fate. Human nature always likes to believe what it cannot understand.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap23"/><span class="chapnum">23</span>Nor was Ptolemy himself slow to incite his master to crime, to which it is only a short step from such ambitions. But whether his criminal designs were deliberate or suddenly conceived, it is impossible to say. He had long been courting the goodwill of the soldiers either in the hope of being adopted by Galba or to prepare the way for treason. On the road from Spain, while the men were marching or on outpost duty, he would address the veterans by name, reminding them how he and they had served together under Nero, and calling them his comrades. He renewed acquaintance <a id="id_1page41"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="41"></a>with some, asked after others and helped them with money or influence, frequently letting fall complaints and ambiguous remarks about Galba, using all the arts which work upon uneducated minds. The soldiers grumbled bitterly at the exertions of the march, the shortage of provisions, and the strict discipline. What they were used to was a journey to the Campanian Lakes or Greek seaports on board ship;<a id="id_1fnm51"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn51" class="fnnum pginternal">51</a> they found it hard to struggle over the Pyrenees and Alps, and march immense distances under arms.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap24"/><span class="chapnum">24</span>While the soldiers were thus already fired with discontent, Maevius Pudens, one of Tigellinus'<a id="id_1fnm52"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn52" class="fnnum pginternal">52</a> intimates, added fuel to their feelings by luring on all who were naturally unstable or in need of money, or rashly eager for a change. Eventually, whenever Galba dined with him, Otho went the length of presenting a hundred sesterces to each of the soldiers on guard, on the pretext that this was instead of entertaining <a id="id_1fnm53"/>them.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn53" class="fnnum pginternal">53</a> This system of public largess Otho extended by making presents in confidence to individuals, and such spirit did he show in bribery that when a member of the Body Guard, Cocceius Proculus, brought an action to <a id="id_1page42"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="42"></a>claim part of his neighbour's farm, Otho bought the whole property out of his own pocket and gave it to him. He was enabled to do this by the inefficiency of the Prefect Laco, who was no less blind to notorious than to secret scandals.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap25"/><span class="chapnum">25</span>Otho then put Onomastus, one of his freedmen, in charge of the projected crime, and Onomastus took into his confidence Barbius Proculus, an aide-de-camp, and a subaltern named Veturius, both in the Body <a id="id_1fnm54"/>Guard.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn54" class="fnnum pginternal">54</a> Having assured himself by many interviews that they were both bold and cunning, Otho proceeded to load them with bribes and promises, providing them with funds to enable them to test the feelings of the others. And so a couple of common soldiers took it upon them to transfer the Roman Empire: and they did it. A very few were admitted as accomplices. These, by various devices, worked on the indecision of the others. The non-commissioned officers who had been promoted by Nymphidius felt themselves under suspicion; the private soldiers were indignant and in despair at the constant postponement of Galba's largess; some few were fired by the recollection of Nero's régime and longed for the days of licence; all in common shared the fear of being drafted out of the Praetorian Guards.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap26"/><span class="chapnum">26</span>The infection of treason soon spread to the legions <a id="id_1page43"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="43"></a>and auxiliaries, whose excitement had been aroused as soon as they heard that the armies of Germany were wavering in their allegiance. So, as the disloyal were ready for treason and the loyal shut their eyes, they at first determined to acclaim Otho as he was returning from dinner on the night of the fourteenth. However, they hesitated: the darkness spelt uncertainty, the troops were scattered all over the town, and unanimity could scarcely be expected from drunken men. They were not deterred by any affection for their country's honour, which they were deliberately preparing to stain with its emperor's blood, but they were afraid that, as Otho was unknown to the majority, some one else might by mistake be offered to the Pannonian or German legions and proclaimed emperor. Some evidence of the brewing plot leaked out, but it was suppressed by the conspirators. Rumours even reached Galba's ears, but Laco made light of them, being totally ignorant of soldiers' characters, hostile to any suggestion, however wise, that was not his own, and extremely obstinate with men who knew more than he did.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap27"/><span class="chapnum">27</span>On January 15, as Galba was sacrificing in front of the temple of Apollo, the priest Umbricius declared the omens unfavourable: treason was impending, and an enemy within the walls. Otho, who was standing beside Galba, overheard and construed the omen as being from his own point of view a good one, favourable to his plans. In a few moments his freedman, Onomastus, announced that the architect and contractors were waiting to see him. This had been agreed <a id="id_1page44"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="44"></a>upon as the signal that the troops were assembling and the conspiracy was ripe. On being asked where he was going, Otho pretended that he was buying an old property, but suspected its condition and so had to inspect it first. Thus, leaning on his freedman's shoulder, he passed through Tiberius' house into the Velabrum and thence to the Golden Milestone at the foot of the Temple of <a id="id_1fnm55"/>Saturn.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn55" class="fnnum pginternal">55</a> There thirty-three soldiers of the Body Guard saluted him as emperor. When he showed alarm at the smallness of their number they put him hastily into a litter, and, drawing their swords, hurried him away. About the same number of soldiers joined them on the way, some accomplices, others merely curious. Some marched along shouting and flourishing swords; others kept silent, intending to take their cue from subsequent events.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap28"/><span class="chapnum">28</span>Julius Martialis was the tribune on duty in the camp. He was so overcome by the magnitude of this unexpected crime and so afraid that the treason was widespread in the camp, and that he might be killed if he offered any opposition, that he led most people to suppose he was in the plot. So, too, the other tribunes and centurions all preferred present safety to a risky loyalty. In fact the general attitude was this: few dared to undertake so foul a crime, many wished to see it done, and everybody was ready to condone it.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00016"><a id="The_Fall_of_Galba"/>The Fall of Galba</h3>
<p><a id="Ichap29"/><span class="chapnum">29</span>Meanwhile Galba in total ignorance and intent upon his sacrifices continued to importune the gods of an empire that had already ceased to be his. First there came a rumour that some one or other of the senators was being hurried to the camp, then that it was Otho. Immediately people who had met Otho came flocking in from all quarters of Rome; some in their terror exaggerated the truth, some minimized it, remembering even then to flatter. After discussion it was decided that the temper of the cohort on guard in the palace should be tested, but not by Galba himself. His authority was held in reserve for more heroic remedies. The troops were summoned. Piso, standing out on the steps of the palace, addressed them as follows:</p>
<p>'Fellow soldiers, it is now five days since I was made a Caesar. I knew nothing of the future nor whether the name was more to be desired or feared. It now lies with you to decide whether or no my adoption is to prove a calamity for my house and for my country. In saying this, I do not dread disaster on my own account. I have known misfortune, and I am now discovering to the full that prosperity is just as dangerous. But for the sake of my adoptive father, of the senate, and of the whole empire, I deplore the thought that we may have to-day either to die or—what for good men is as wretched—to kill. In the recent revolution our comfort was that Rome was spared the sight of blood, and the transfer was effected <a id="id_1page46"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="46"></a>without disturbance. We thought that my adoption would be a safeguard against an outbreak of civil war even after Galba's death.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap30"/><span class="chapnum">30</span>'I will make no claims to rank or respectability. To compare myself with Otho, I need not recite my virtues. His vices are all he has to be proud of. They ruined the empire, even when he was only playing the part of an emperor's friend. Why should he deserve to be emperor? For his swaggering demeanour? For his effeminate costume? Extravagance imposes on some people. They take it for liberality. They are wrong. He will know how to squander money, but not how to give it away. His mind is full of lechery and debauchery and intrigues with women. These are in his eyes the prerogatives of the throne. And the pleasure of his vices would be all his, the blushes of shame would be ours. No man has ever ruled well who won the throne by bad means.</p>
<p>'The whole Roman world agreed to give Galba the title of Caesar. Galba with your approval gave that title to me. Even if the "country", the "senate", the "people", are empty terms, it is to your interest, my fellow soldiers, to see that it is not the rascals who create an emperor. From time to time one hears of the legionaries being in mutiny against their generals. But your good faith and your good name have stood to this day unimpaired. It was not you who deserted Nero: he deserted you. Are you going to allow less than thirty deserters and renegades to bestow the crown? Why! no one would tolerate their choosing <a id="id_1page47"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="47"></a>so much as a centurion or a tribune for themselves. Are you going to allow this precedent, and by your acquiescence make their crime your own? You will soon see this lawless spirit spreading to the troops abroad, and in time the treason will recoil on us and the war on you. Besides, innocence wins you as much as the murder of your emperor: you will get from us as large a bounty for your loyalty as you would from others for your crime.'</p>
<p><a id="Ichap31"/><span class="chapnum">31</span>The members of the Body Guard dispersed. The rest of the cohort paid some heed to his speech. Aimlessly, as happens in moments of confusion, they seized their standards, without as yet any fixed plan, and not, as was afterwards believed, to cloak their treachery. Marius Celsus had been dispatched to the picked detachments of the Illyrian army, which were quartered in the Vipsanian <a id="id_1fnm56"/>arcade,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn56" class="fnnum pginternal">56</a> while instructions had been given to two senior <a id="id_1fnm57"/>centurions,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn57" class="fnnum pginternal">57</a> Amullius Serenus and Domitius Sabinus, to summon the German troops from the Hall of Liberty. They distrusted the legion of marines, who had been alienated by Galba's <a id="id_1page48"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="48"></a>butchery of their comrades on his entry into <a id="id_1fnm58"/>Rome.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn58" class="fnnum pginternal">58</a> Three officers of the guards, Cetrius Severus, Subrius Dexter, and Pompeius Longinus, also hurried to the camp in the hope that the mutiny was still in its early stages and might be averted by good advice before it came to a head. The soldiers attacked Subrius and Cetrius with threats and forcibly seizing Longinus disarmed him, because he had not come in virtue of his military rank, but simply as one of Galba's private friends; and for his loyalty to his master the rebels disliked him all the more. The marines without any hesitation joined the guards. The Illyrian <a id="id_1fnm59"/>draft<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn59" class="fnnum pginternal">59</a> drove Celsus away at the point of their javelins. The German detachments<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn59" class="fnnum pginternal">59</a> wavered for some time. They were still in poor condition physically, and inclined to be passive. Nero had dispatched them as an advance-guard to Alexandria;<a id="id_1fnm60"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn60" class="fnnum pginternal">60</a> the long voyage back again had damaged their health, and Galba had spared no expense in looking after them.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap32"/><span class="chapnum">32</span>The whole populace of Rome was now crowding into the palace together with a good sprinkling of slaves. With discordant shouts they demanded the death of Otho and the doom of the conspirators. They might have been in the circus or the theatre, clamouring for entertainment. There was neither sense nor sincerity in their behaviour. They were quite ready on the same day to clamour for the opposite with equal zeal. <a id="id_1page49"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="49"></a>But it is an established custom to flatter any emperor with unbridled cheering and meaningless enthusiasm. Meanwhile Galba was torn between two opinions. Titus Vinius maintained that they ought to remain within the palace, employ the slaves to offer resistance and block up all the doors, instead of going out to face the angry troops. 'This will give time,' he urged, 'for the disloyal to repent and the loyal to unite their forces. Crimes demand haste, good counsels profit by delay. Besides, if need be, we shall have the same chance of leaving the palace later: if we leave and repent of it, it will not be in our power to return.'</p>
<p><a id="Ichap33"/><span class="chapnum">33</span>All the others voted for immediate action before the conspiracy gathered strength and numbers. 'Otho,' they argued, 'will soon lose heart. He crept away by stealth and was introduced in a litter to a parcel of strangers, and now because we dally and waste time he has leisure to rehearse his part of emperor. What is the good of waiting until Otho sets his camp in order and approaches the Capitol, while Galba peeps out of a window? Are this famous general and his gallant friends to shut the doors and not to stir a foot over the threshold, as if they were anxious to endure a siege? Much help may we hope from slaves, when once the unwieldy crowd loses its unity and their first indignation, which counts for so much, begins to cool. No, cowardice is too risky. Or if we must fall, let us meet the danger half-way, and cover Otho with disgrace, ourselves with honour.'</p>
<p><a id="id_1page50"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="50"></a>When Vinius resisted this proposal, Laco, prompted by Icelus, assailed him with threats, persisting in his private quarrel to the ruin of his country. <a id="Ichap34"/><span class="chapnum">34</span>Galba without further delay supported those whose plan would look best. However, Piso was first dispatched to the camp. The young man had a great name, his popularity was still fresh, and moreover, he disliked Titus Vinius, or, if he did not, Vinius' enemies hoped he did: it is so easy to believe in hatred. Scarcely had Piso departed, when there arrived a rumour that Otho had been killed in the camp. At first it was vague and uncertain, but eventually, as so often happens with daring lies, people began to assert that they had been present and seen the deed. Some were glad and some indifferent, so the news gained easy credence. Many, however, thought that the report had been concocted and disseminated by friends of Otho, who now mingled in the crowd and tried to lure Galba out by spreading this agreeable falsehood. <a id="Ichap35"/><span class="chapnum">35</span>At this point not only the populace and the inexperienced mob but many of the knights and senators as well broke out into applause and unbridled enthusiasm. With their fear they had lost their caution. Breaking open the palace gates they rushed in and presented themselves before Galba, complaining that they had been forestalled in the task of revenge. All the cowards who, as events proved, could show no pluck in action, indulged in excessive heroics and lip-courage. Nobody knew, everybody talked. At last, for lack of the truth, Galba yielded to the consensus of error. When he had put on his <a id="id_1page51"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="51"></a>breastplate he was lifted into a chair, for he was too old and infirm to stand against the crowds that kept flocking in. In the palace he was met by Julius Atticus, of the Body Guard, who displayed a dripping sword and shouted out that he had killed Otho. 'Comrade,' said Galba, 'who bade you?' Galba had a remarkable power of curbing soldiers' presumption, for he was not afraid of threats nor moved by flattery.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap36"/><span class="chapnum">36</span>Meanwhile in Otho's camp there was no longer any doubt of the soldiers' unanimity. Such was their enthusiasm that they were not content with carrying Otho shoulder-high in procession; they placed him among the standards on the platform, where shortly before a gilt statue of Galba had stood, and made a ring round him with their <a id="id_1fnm61"/>colours.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn61" class="fnnum pginternal">61</a> Tribunes and centurions were allowed no approach: the common soldiers even called out, 'Beware of the officers.' The whole camp resounded with confused shouts of mutual encouragement. It was quite unlike the wavering and spiritless flattery of a civil mob. As new adherents streamed in, directly a soldier caught sight of one of them, he grasped him by the hand, flung his arms round him, kept him at his side, and dictated the oath of allegiance. Some commended their general to his soldiers, and some the soldiers to their general. Otho, for his part, was not slow to greet the crowd with outstretched hand and throw kisses to them. In every way he played the slave to gain a throne. When <a id="id_1page52"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="52"></a>the whole legion of the marines had sworn allegiance, he gained confidence in his strength, and, considering that those whom he had incited individually needed a few words of general encouragement, he stood out on the rampart and began as follows:—<a id="Ichap37"/><span class="chapnum">37</span>'In what guise I come forward to address you, Fellow Soldiers, I cannot tell. Dubbed emperor by you, I dare not call myself a private citizen: yet "emperor" I cannot say with another on the throne. And what am I to call you? That too will remain in doubt until it is decided whether you have here in your camp an enemy or an emperor of Rome. You hear how they clamour at once for my death and your punishment. So clear is it that we must fall or stand together. Doubtless Galba—such is his clemency—has already promised our destruction. Is he not the man who without the least excuse butchered thousands of utterly innocent <a id="id_1fnm62"/>soldiers?<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn62" class="fnnum pginternal">62</a> I shudder whenever I recall his ghastly entry into the city, when before the face of Rome he ordered the decimation of the troops whom at their humble petition he had taken under his protection. That is Galba's only "victory". These were the auspices under which he made his entry; and what glory has he brought to the throne he occupies, save the murder of Obultronius Sabinus and Cornelius Marcellus in Spain, of Betuus Cilo in Gaul, of Fonteius Capito in Germany, of Clodius Macer in Africa, of Cingonius on his march to Rome, of Turpilianus in the city, and of Nymphidius in the camp? What <a id="id_1page53"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="53"></a>province is there in the empire that has not been polluted with massacre? He calls it "salutary correction". For his "remedies" are what other people call crimes: his cruelty is disguised as "austerity", his avarice as "economy", while by "discipline" he means punishing and insulting you. It is but seven months since Nero's death, and already Icelus alone has embezzled more than all the depredations of Polyclitus and Vatinius and <a id="id_1fnm63"/>Aegialus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn63" class="fnnum pginternal">63</a> put together. Why, Vinius would have been less greedy and lawless had he been emperor himself. As it is, he treats us as his own subjects and despises us as Galba's. His own fortune alone could provide the largess which they daily cast in your teeth but never pay into your pocket.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap38"/><span class="chapnum">38</span>'Nor in Galba's successor either is there any hope for you. Galba has seen to that. He has recalled from exile the man whose avarice and sour temper he judged most like his own. You witnessed for yourselves, my comrades, the extraordinary storm which signified Heaven's abhorrence at that ill-starred adoption. The Senate and People of Rome feel the same. They are counting on your courage. You alone can give strength to the right policy: it is powerless without you, however good it be. It is <a id="id_1page54"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="54"></a>not to war and danger that I call you. All the troops are with us. That single plain-clothes <a id="id_1fnm64"/>cohort<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn64" class="fnnum pginternal">64</a> is no longer a defence to Galba, but a hindrance. When once they have caught sight of you, when once they come to take their orders from me, the only quarrel between you will be who can do most to put me in their debt. There is no room for delay in plans which cannot be commended until they are put into action.'</p>
<p>Otho then gave orders to open the arsenal. The soldiers immediately seized their arms in such haste that all the ordinary distinctions of the service were neglected: neither Guards nor Legionaries carried their own arms:<a id="id_1fnm65"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn65" class="fnnum pginternal">65</a> in the confusion they took the helmets and shields of the auxiliaries. There were no tribunes or centurions to encourage them: each man followed his own lead, and the rascals found their chief incentive in the consternation of the loyal. <a id="Ichap39"/><span class="chapnum">39</span>As the riot increased, Piso, alarmed by the din of their shouts, which could be heard even in the city, had overtaken Galba, who had meanwhile left the palace and was approaching the Forum. Marius Celsus had also brought back no good news. Some were for returning to the palace, others for seeking the shelter of the Capitol, many for seizing the Rostra. The majority merely disagreed with other people's proposals, and, as so often happens <a id="id_1page55"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="55"></a>in these disasters, the best course always seemed the one for which it was now too late. It is said that Laco, without Galba's knowledge, proposed the assassination of Titus Vinius, either with the idea that his execution would be a sop to the soldiers, or because he believed him Otho's accomplice, or, as a last alternative, hatred may have been his motive. However, the time and the place both bred scruples; when killing once begins it is difficult to set a limit: besides, their plans were upset by the arrival of terrified messengers, by the continual desertion of their supporters, and by a general waning of enthusiasm even among those who at first had been the keenest to display their loyalty and courage.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap40"/><span class="chapnum">40</span>Galba was driven hither and thither by the tide of the surging mob. The temples and public <a id="id_1fnm66"/>buildings<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn66" class="fnnum pginternal">66</a> were crowded with spectators, who viewed a sorry scene. No shouts came from the crowd: astonishment was on their faces, and their ears open to every sound. There was neither uproar nor quiet, but the silence of strong emotion and alarm. However, a report reached Otho that the populace was arming. He bade his men fly headlong to forestall the danger. Off went the Roman soldiers as if they were going to drag Vologaesus or Pacorus from the ancestral throne of the <a id="id_1fnm67"/>Arsacids<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn67" class="fnnum pginternal">67</a>—and not to butcher their own emperor, <a id="id_1page56"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="56"></a>a helpless old man. Armed to the teeth, they broke at a full gallop into the Forum, scattering the populace and trampling senators under foot. Neither the sight of the Capitol nor the sanctity of the temples towering above them, nor the thought of Roman emperors past and to come, could avail to deter them from committing that crime which the next successor always avenges.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap41"/><span class="chapnum">41</span>Seeing the armed ranks now close at hand, the standard-bearer of the cohort on guard over <a id="id_1fnm68"/>Galba<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn68" class="fnnum pginternal">68</a>—tradition says his name was Atilius Vergilio—tore off the medallion of <a id="id_1fnm69"/>Galba<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn69" class="fnnum pginternal">69</a> and flung it to the ground. This signal clearly showed that all the troops were for Otho: the people fled from the deserted Forum and swords were drawn against any who lingered. Near 'Lake Curtius'<a id="id_1fnm70"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn70" class="fnnum pginternal">70</a> Galba was precipitated from his chair by the panic-stricken haste of the bearers and flung to the ground. The accounts of his last words vary according as they are prompted by hatred or admiration. Some say that he whined and asked what harm he had deserved, begging for a few days' respite to pay the troops their largess. The majority say that he offered his neck to the blow and bade them, 'Come, strike, if it serves the country's need.' Whatever he said mattered little to his assassins. As to the actual <a id="id_1page57"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="57"></a>murderer there is a difference of opinion. Some say it was Terentius, a <a id="id_1fnm71"/>reservist,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn71" class="fnnum pginternal">71</a> others that his name was Laecanius. The most common account is that a soldier of the Fifteenth legion, by name Camurius, pierced his throat with a sword-thrust. The others foully mangled his arms and legs (his breast was covered) and with bestial savagery continued to stab the headless corpse. <a id="Ichap42"/><span class="chapnum">42</span>Then they made for Titus Vinius. Here, too, there is a doubt whether the fear of imminent death strangled his voice, or whether he called out that they had no mandate from Otho to kill him. He may have invented this in his terror, or it may have been a confession of his complicity in the plot. His whole life and reputation give reason to suppose that he was an accomplice in the crime of which he was the cause. He was brought to the ground in front of the temple of Julius by a blow on the knee, and afterwards a common soldier named Julius Carus ran him through with a sword.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap43"/><span class="chapnum">43</span>However, Rome found one hero that day. This was Sempronius Densus, a centurion of the Guards, who had been told off by Galba to protect Piso. Drawing his dagger he faced the armed assassins, flinging their treason in their teeth, and by his shouts and gestures turned their attention upon himself, thus enabling <a id="id_1page58"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="58"></a>Piso to escape despite his wounds. Piso, reaching the temple of Vesta, was mercifully sheltered by the verger, who hid him in his lodging. There, no reverence for this sanctuary but merely his concealment postponed his immediate death. Eventually, Otho, who was burning to have him <a id="id_1fnm72"/>killed,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-3.htm.html#id_1fn72" class="fnnum pginternal">72</a> dispatched as special agents, Sulpicius Florus of the British cohorts, a man whom Galba had recently enfranchised, and Statius Murcus of the Body Guard. They dragged Piso forth and butchered him on the threshold of the temple.</p>

It was also applied at this time in a special sense to a corps of young knights, who, without losing their status, acted as Galba's special body-guard in the imperial palace. One of these may have been the murderer.</p>

<p><a id="Ichap44"/><span class="chapnum">44</span>None of his murders pleased Otho so much as this. On Piso's head, as on no other, they say, he gazed with insatiable eyes. This was possibly the first moment at which he felt relieved of all anxiety, and free to indulge his glee; or perhaps, in the case of Galba and of Vinius, the recollection of his treason to the one and of his former friendship with the other troubled even his unfeeling heart with gloomy thoughts, whereas, Piso being an enemy and a rival, he considered it a pious duty to gloat over his murder. Their heads were fixed on poles and carried along with the standards of the cohorts side by side with the eagle of the <a id="id_1fnm73"/>legion.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-3.htm.html#id_1fn73" class="fnnum pginternal">73</a> Those who had done the deed and those who had witnessed it vied with each other in displaying their bloody hands, all boasting of their share—some falsely, <a id="id_1page59"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="59"></a>some truly—as if it were a fine and memorable exploit. Vitellius subsequently discovered more than 120 petitions demanding rewards for distinguished services rendered on that day. He gave orders to search out all the petitioners and put them to death. This was from no respect for Galba: he merely followed the traditional custom by which princes secure their present safety and posthumous vengeance.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap45"/><span class="chapnum">45</span>The senate and people seemed different men. There was a general rush for the camp, every one shouldering his neighbour and trying to overtake those in front. They heaped insults on Galba, praised the prudence of the troops, and covered Otho's hand with kisses, their extravagance varying inversely with their sincerity. Otho rebuffed no one, and succeeded by his words and looks in moderating the menace of the soldiers' greed for vengeance. They loudly demanded the execution of Marius Celsus, the consul-elect, who had remained Galba's faithful friend to the last. They were as much offended at his efficiency and honesty as if these had been criminal qualities. What they wanted was obviously to find a first excuse for plunder and murder and the destruction of all decent citizens. But Otho had as yet no influence to prevent crimes: he could only order them. So he simulated anger, giving instructions for Celsus' arrest, and by promising that he should meet with a worse penalty, thus rescued him from immediate death.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap46"/><span class="chapnum">46</span>The will of the soldiers was now henceforward supreme. The Praetorian Guards chose their own <a id="id_1page60"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="60"></a>prefects, Plotius Firmus, a man who had risen from the ranks to the post of Chief of <a id="id_1fnm74"/>Police,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-3.htm.html#id_1fn74" class="fnnum pginternal">74</a> and joined Otho's side before Galba's fall, and Licinius Proculus, an intimate friend of Otho, and therefore suspected of furthering his plans. They made Flavius <a id="id_1fnm75"/>Sabinus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-3.htm.html#id_1fn75" class="fnnum pginternal">75</a> prefect of the city, therein following Nero's choice, under whom Sabinus had held that post; besides, most of them had an eye to the fact that he was Vespasian's brother. An urgent demand arose that the customary fees to centurions for granting furlough should be abolished, for they constituted a sort of annual tax upon the common soldier. The result had been that a quarter of each company could go off on leave or lounge idly about the barracks, so long as they paid the centurion his fee, nor was there any one to control either the amount of this impost or the means by which the soldiers raised the money: highway robbery or menial service was the usual resort whereby they purchased leisure. Then, again, a soldier who had money was savagely burdened with work until he should buy exemption. Thus he soon became impoverished and enervated by idleness, and returned to his company no longer a man of means and energy but penniless and lazy. So the process went on. One after another they became deteriorated by poverty and lax discipline, rushing blindly into quarrels and <a id="id_1page61"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="61"></a>mutiny, and, as a last resource, into civil war. Otho was afraid of alienating the centurions by his concessions to the rank and file, and promised to pay the annual furlough-fees out of his private purse. This was indubitably a sound reform, which good emperors have since established as a regular custom in the army. The prefect Laco he pretended to banish to an island, but on his arrival he was stabbed by a <a id="id_1fnm76"/>reservist<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-3.htm.html#id_1fn76" class="fnnum pginternal">76</a> whom Otho had previously dispatched for that purpose. Marcianus Icelus, as being one of his own freedmen,<a id="id_1fnm77"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-3.htm.html#id_1fn77" class="fnnum pginternal">77</a> he sentenced to public execution.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap47"/><span class="chapnum">47</span>Thus the day was spent in crimes, and worst of all was the joy they caused. The senate was summoned by the urban <a id="id_1fnm78"/>praetor.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-3.htm.html#id_1fn78" class="fnnum pginternal">78</a> The other magistrates all vied in flattery. The senators arrived post-haste. They decreed to Otho the powers of the tribunate, the title of Augustus, and all the imperial prerogatives. Their unanimous object was to blot out all recollection of former insults; but, as these had been hurled equally from all sides, they did not, as far as any one could see, stick in his memory. Whether he had forgotten them or only postponed punishment, his reign was too short to show. He was then carried through the still reeking Forum among the piles of dead bodies to the Capitol, and thence to the palace. He granted permission to burn and bury the bodies of his victims. <a id="id_1page62"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="62"></a>Piso's wife Verania and his brother Scribonianus laid out his body, and this was done for Vinius by his daughter Crispina. They had to search for the heads and buy them back from the murderers, who had preserved them for sale.</p>
