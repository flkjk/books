<h3 id="pgepubid00042"><a id="Vitellius_Measures"/>Vitellius' Measures of Defence</h3>
<p><a id="IIIchap54"/><span class="chapnum">54</span>After the crushing defeat at Cremona Vitellius stupidly suppressed the news of the disaster, thus postponing not the danger itself but only his precautions against it. Had he admitted the facts and sought advice, hope and strength were still left to him: his pretension that all went well only made matters worse. He was himself extraordinarily silent about the war, and in Rome all discussion of the subject was forbidden. This only increased the number of people who, if permitted, would have told the truth, but in the face of this prohibition spread grossly exaggerated rumours. Nor were the Flavian leaders slow to foster these rumours. Whenever they captured Vitellian spies they escorted them round the camp to show them the strength of the winning army, and sent them back <a id="id_2page63"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="63"></a>again. Vitellius cross-examined each of them in private and then had them murdered. A centurion named Julius Agrestis, after many interviews, in which he endeavoured in vain to fire Vitellius' courage, at last with heroic persistence induced the emperor to send him to inspect the enemy's forces and discover what had really happened at Cremona. He made no attempt to deceive Antonius by concealing the object of his mission, but openly avowed the emperor's instructions, stated his intentions and demanded to be shown everything. He was given guides, who showed him the field of battle, the ruins of Cremona and the captured legions. Back went Agrestis to Vitellius. Finding that the emperor disbelieved his report and even suggested that he had been bribed, he said, 'You want some certain evidence and, since you have no further use for me either alive or dead, I will give you evidence that you can believe.' And he was as good as his word. He went straight from the emperor's presence and committed suicide. Some say he was killed by order of Vitellius, but they give the same account of his heroic devotion.<a id="id_2fnm145"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn145" class="2fnnum pginternal">145</a></p>
<p><a id="IIIchap55"/><span class="chapnum">55</span>Vitellius was like a man roused from sleep. He dispatched Julius Priscus and Alfenus <a id="id_2fnm146"/>Varus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn146" class="2fnnum pginternal">146</a> with fourteen cohorts of Guards and all his available cavalry to hold the Apennines. A legion levied from <a id="id_2page64"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="64"></a>the <a id="id_2fnm147"/>marines<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn147" class="2fnnum pginternal">147</a> was sent after them. This large army of picked men and horses, if there had been any general to lead it, was strong enough to have even taken the offensive. His other <a id="id_2fnm148"/>cohorts<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn148" class="2fnnum pginternal">148</a> were given to his brother, Lucius Vitellius, for the protection of the city. The emperor himself gave up none of his habitual luxuries, but, feeling nervous and depressed, he hurried on the elections and nominated consuls for several years in advance. He lavished special <a id="id_2fnm149"/>charters<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn149" class="2fnnum pginternal">149</a> on allied communities and extended Latin <a id="id_2fnm150"/>rights<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn150" class="2fnnum pginternal">150</a> to foreign towns: he remitted taxation here, granted immunities there. In fact, he took no thought for the future, and did his best to cripple the empire. However, the mob accepted these munificent grants with open mouths. Fools paid money for them, but wise men held them invalid, since they could be neither given nor received without a revolution. At last he yielded to the demands of the army and joined the camp at <a id="id_2fnm151"/>Mevania,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn151" class="2fnnum pginternal">151</a> where they had taken up their position. A long train of senators followed him, many moved by their ambition, but most by their fears. Here he <a id="id_2page65"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="65"></a>was still undecided and at the mercy of treacherous advice.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap56"/><span class="chapnum">56</span>During one of his speeches a portent occurred. A cloud of ill-omened <a id="id_2fnm152"/>birds<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn152" class="2fnnum pginternal">152</a> flew over his head and its density obscured the daylight. To this was added another omen of disaster. A bull broke from the altar, scattered the utensils for the ceremony, and escaped so far away that it had to be killed instead of being sacrificed according to the proper ritual. But the chief portent was Vitellius himself. He was ignorant of soldiering, incapable of forethought: knew nothing of drill or scouting, or how far operations should be pressed forward or protracted. He always had to ask some one else. At every fresh piece of news his expression and gait betrayed his alarm. And then he would get drunk. At last he found camp life too tedious, and on learning of a mutiny in the fleet at <a id="id_2fnm153"/>Misenum<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn153" class="2fnnum pginternal">153</a> he returned to Rome. Every fresh blow terrified him, but of the real crisis he seemed insensible. For it was open to him to cross the Apennines and with his full strength unimpaired to attack the enemy while they were worn out with cold and hunger. But by breaking up his forces he sent his keenest soldiers, stubbornly loyal to the last, to be killed or taken prisoner. The more experienced of his centurions disapproved of this policy and would have told him the truth, if they had been consulted. But the emperor's intimates refused <a id="id_2page66"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="66"></a>them admittance. He had, indeed, formed a habit of regarding wholesome advice as unpleasant, and refusing to listen to any that was not agreeable, and in the long run fatal.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap57"/><span class="chapnum">57</span>In civil war individual enterprise counts for much. The mutiny of the fleet at Misenum had been engineered by Claudius Faventinus, a centurion whom Galba had dismissed in disgrace. To obtain his object he had forged a letter from Vespasian promising rewards for treachery. The admiral, Claudius <a id="id_2fnm154"/>Apollinaris,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn154" class="2fnnum pginternal">154</a> was neither a staunch loyalist nor an enthusiastic traitor. Accordingly Apinius Tiro, an ex-praetor, who happened to be at <a id="id_2fnm155"/>Minturnae,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn155" class="2fnnum pginternal">155</a> offered to take the lead of the rebels. They proceeded to win over the colonies and country towns. Puteoli in particular was strong for Vespasian, while Capua remained loyal to Vitellius, for they dragged their local jealousies into the civil war. To pacify the excited troops Vitellius chose Claudius Julianus, who had lately been in command of the fleet at Misenum and had allowed lax discipline. To support him he was given one cohort of the city garrison and the force of gladiators already serving under him. The two parties encamped close to one another, and it was not long before Julianus came over to Vespasian's side. They then joined forces and occupied Tarracina,<a id="id_2fnm156"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn156" class="2fnnum pginternal">156</a> which owed its strength more to <a id="id_2page67"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="67"></a>its walls and situation than to the character of its new garrison.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap58"/><span class="chapnum">58</span>When news of this reached Vitellius, he left part of his force at <a id="id_2fnm157"/>Narnia<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn157" class="2fnnum pginternal">157</a> with the prefects of the <a id="id_2fnm158"/>Guard,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn158" class="2fnnum pginternal">158</a> and sent his brother Lucius with six regiments of Guards and five hundred horse to cope with the threatened outbreak in Campania. His own nervous depression was somewhat relieved by the enthusiasm of the troops and of the populace, who clamoured loudly for arms. For he dignified this poor-spirited mob, which would never dare to do anything but shout, by the specious titles of 'the army' or 'his legions'. His friends were all untrustworthy in proportion to their eminence; but on the advice of his freedmen he held a levy for conscription and swore in all who gave their names. As their numbers were too great, he gave the task of selection to the two consuls. From each of the senators he levied a fixed number of slaves and a weight of silver. The knights offered money and personal service, while even freedmen volunteered similar assistance. Indeed, protestations of loyalty prompted by fear, had gradually changed into real sympathy. People began to feel pity, not perhaps so much for Vitellius as for the throne and its misfortunes. He himself by his looks, his voice, his tears made ceaseless demands upon their compassion, promising rewards lavishly and, as men do when they are frightened, beyond all limits. He had hitherto <a id="id_2page68"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="68"></a>refused the title of Caesar,<a id="id_2fnm159"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn159" class="2fnnum pginternal">159</a> but he now expressed a wish for it. He had a superstitious respect for the name, and in moments of terror one listens as much to gossip as to sound advice. However, while a rash and ill-conceived undertaking may prosper at the outset, in time it always begins to flag. Gradually the senators and knights deserted him. At first they hesitated and waited till his back was turned, but soon they ceased to care and openly showed their disrespect. At last Vitellius grew ashamed of the failure of his efforts and excused them from the services which they refused to render.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00043"><a id="The_Passage"/>The Passage of the Apennines</h3>
<p><a id="IIIchap59"/><span class="chapnum">59</span>The occupation of <a id="id_2fnm160"/>Mevania<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn160" class="2fnnum pginternal">160</a> had terrified Italy with the prospect of a revival of the war, but Vitellius' cowardly <a id="id_2fnm161"/>retreat<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn161" class="2fnnum pginternal">161</a> sensibly strengthened the popularity of the Flavian party. The Samnites, Pelignians, and Marsians were now induced to rise. They were jealous of Campania for stealing a march on them, and the change of masters, as so often happens, made them perform all their military duties with the utmost alacrity. But in crossing the Apennines Antonius' army suffered severely from the rough December weather. Though they met with no opposition, they found it hard enough to struggle through the snow, and realized what danger they would have had to face if Vitellius had not happened to turn back. Certainly chance helped the Flavian generals quite as often <a id="id_2page69"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="69"></a>as their own strategy. Here they came across Petilius Cerialis,<a id="id_2fnm162"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn162" class="2fnnum pginternal">162</a> who had been enabled by his knowledge of the country to elude Vitellius' outposts, disguised as a peasant. As he was a near relative of Vespasian and a distinguished soldier he was given a place on the staff. Several authorities say that Flavius Sabinus and <a id="id_2fnm163"/>Domitian<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn163" class="2fnnum pginternal">163</a> were also afforded facilities for escape, and that Antonius sent messengers who contrived by various devices to get through to them, and made arrangements for an interview and safe conduct. Sabinus, however, pleaded that his health was unequal to the fatigue of such a bold step. Domitian was quite ready to venture, but although the guards to whom Vitellius had entrusted him, promised that they would share his flight, he was afraid they might be laying a trap for him. As a matter of fact, Vitellius was too anxious for the safety of his own relatives to plot any harm against Domitian.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap60"/><span class="chapnum">60</span>Arrived at <a id="id_2fnm164"/>Carsulae<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn164" class="2fnnum pginternal">164</a> the Flavian generals took a few days' rest and awaited the arrival of the main legionary <a id="id_2fnm165"/>force.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn165" class="2fnnum pginternal">165</a> The place suited them admirably for an encampment. It commanded a wide view, and with so many prosperous towns in the rear their supplies were safe. The Vitellians too, were only ten miles away, and they had hopes of negotiating treason <a id="id_2page70"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="70"></a>with them. The soldiers chafed at this delay, preferring victory to peace. They did not even want to wait for their own legions, for there would be more plunder than danger to share with them. Antonius accordingly summoned a meeting of the men and explained to them that Vitellius still had troops at his command. Reflection might make them waver, despair would steel their hearts. In civil war, he told them, the first steps may be left to chance, nothing but careful strategy can win the final victory. The fleet at Misenum and the richest districts of Campania had already deserted Vitellius, and in the whole world nothing was left to him now except the country between Narnia and Tarracina. The battle of Cremona had brought them credit enough, and the destruction of the town more than enough discredit. Their desire must be not to take Rome but to save it. They would gain richer rewards and far more glory if they could show that they had saved the senate and people of Rome without shedding a drop of blood. Such considerations as these calmed their excitement, and it was not long before the legions arrived.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap61"/><span class="chapnum">61</span>Alarmed at the repute of this augmented army, Vitellius' Guards began to waver. There was no one to encourage them to fight, while many urged them to desert, being eager to hand over their companies or squadrons to the enemy and by such a gift to secure the victor's gratitude for the future. These also let the Flavians know that the next camp at <a id="id_2fnm166"/>Interamna<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn166" class="2fnnum pginternal">166</a><a id="id_2page71"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="71"></a> had a garrison of four hundred cavalry. Varus was promptly sent off with a light marching force, and the few who offered resistance were killed. The majority threw away their arms and begged for quarter. Some escaped to the main <a id="id_2fnm167"/>camp<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn167" class="2fnnum pginternal">167</a> and spread universal panic by exaggerating the strength and prowess of the enemy, in order to mitigate the disgrace of losing the fort. In the Vitellian camp all offences went unpunished: desertion met with sure reward. Their loyalty soon gave way and a competition in treachery began. Tribunes and centurions deserted daily, but not the common soldiers, who had grown stubbornly faithful to Vitellius. At last, however, Priscus and <a id="id_2fnm168"/>Alfenus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn168" class="2fnnum pginternal">168</a> abandoned the camp and returned to Vitellius, thus finally releasing all the others from any obligation to blush for their treachery.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap62"/><span class="chapnum">62</span>About the same time Fabius <a id="id_2fnm169"/>Valens<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn169" class="2fnnum pginternal">169</a> was executed in his prison at Urbinum, and his head was exhibited to Vitellius' Guards to show them that further hope was vain. For they cherished a belief that Valens had made his way into Germany, and was there mustering his old force and fresh troops as well. This evidence of his death threw them into despair. The Flavian army was vastly inspirited by it and regarded Valens' death as the end of the war.</p>
<p>Valens had been born at Anagnia of an equestrian family. He was a man of loose morality, not without intellectual gifts, who by indulging in frivolity <a id="id_2page72"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="72"></a>posed as a wit. In Nero's time he had acted in a harlequinade at the Juvenalian <a id="id_2fnm170"/>Games.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn170" class="2fnnum pginternal">170</a> At first he pleaded compulsion, but afterwards he acted voluntarily, and his performances were rather clever than respectable. Rising to the command of a legion, he supported <a id="id_2fnm171"/>Verginius<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn171" class="2fnnum pginternal">171</a> and then defamed his character. He murdered Fonteius Capito,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-12.htm.html#id_2fn171" class="2fnnum pginternal">171</a> whose loyalty he had undermined—or perhaps because he had failed to do so. He betrayed Galba and remained faithful to Vitellius, a merit to which the treachery of others served as a foil.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap63"/><span class="chapnum">63</span>Now that their hopes were crushed on all sides, the Vitellians prepared to go over to the enemy. But even at this crisis they saved their honour by marching down with their standards and colours to the plains below Narnia, where the Flavian army was drawn up in full armour ready for battle in two deep lines on either side of the road. The Vitellians marched in between and were surrounded. Antonius then spoke to them kindly and told them to remain, some at Narnia and some at Interamna. He also left behind some of the victorious legions, which were strong enough to quell any outbreak but would not molest them so long as they remained quiet.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00044"><a id="The_Abdication"/>The Abdication of Vitellius and the Burning of the Capitol</h3>
<p>During these days Antonius and Varus kept sending messages to Vitellius, in which they offered him his life, a gift of money, and the choice of a safe retreat in Campania, if he would stop the war and surrender himself and his children to Vespasian. Mucianus wrote him letters to the same effect. Vitellius usually took these offers seriously and talked about the number of slaves he would have and the choice of a seaside place. He had sunk, indeed, into such mental torpor that, if other people had not remembered that he was an emperor, he was certainly beginning to forget it himself. <a id="IIIchap64"/><span class="chapnum">64</span>However, it was to Flavius Sabinus, the City Prefect, that the leading men at Rome addressed themselves. They urged him secretly not to lose all share in the glory of victory. They pointed out that the City Garrison was under his own command, and that he could count on the police and their own bands of slaves, to say nothing of the good fortune of the party and all the advantage that victory gives. He must not leave all the glory to Antonius and Varus. Vitellius had nothing left but a few regiments of guards, who were seriously alarmed at the bad news which came from every quarter. As for the populace, their feelings soon changed, and if he put himself at their head, they would be just as loud in their flattery of Vespasian. Vitellius himself could not even cope <a id="id_2page74"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="74"></a>with success, and disaster had positively paralysed him. The credit of ending the war would go to the man who seized the city. It was eminently fitting that Sabinus should secure the throne for his brother, and that Vespasian should hold him higher than any one else.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap65"/><span class="chapnum">65</span>Age had enfeebled Sabinus, and he showed no alacrity to listen to such talk as this. Some people covertly insinuated that he was jealous of his brother's success and was trying to delay its realization. Flavius Sabinus was the elder brother and, while they were both private persons, he had been the richer and more influential. It was also believed that he had been chary in helping Vespasian to recover his financial position, and had taken a mortgage on his house and estates. Consequently, though they remained openly friendly, there were suspicions of a secret enmity between them. The more charitable explanation is that Sabinus's gentle nature shrank from the idea of bloodshed and massacre, and that this was his reason for so constantly discussing with Vitellius the prospects of peace and a capitulation on terms. After several interviews at his house they finally came to a settlement—so the report went—at the Temple of <a id="id_2fnm172"/>Apollo.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn172" class="2fnnum pginternal">172</a> To the actual conversation there were only two witnesses, Cluvius <a id="id_2fnm173"/>Rufus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn173" class="2fnnum pginternal">173</a> and Silius <a id="id_2fnm174"/>Italicus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn174" class="2fnnum pginternal">174</a> but the expression of their faces was watched from a distance.<a id="id_2page75"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="75"></a> Vitellius was said to look abject and demoralized: Sabinus showed less sign of pride than of pity.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap66"/><span class="chapnum">66</span>Had Vitellius found it no harder to persuade his friends than to make his own renunciation, Vespasian's army might have marched into Rome without bloodshed. But as it was, each of his friends in proportion to his loyalty persisted in refusing terms of peace. They pointed to the danger and disgrace. Would their conqueror keep his promises any longer than he liked? However great Vespasian's self-confidence, he could not allow Vitellius to live in private. Nor would the losers acquiesce: their very pity would be a menace.<a id="id_2fnm175"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn175" class="2fnnum pginternal">175</a> 'Of course,' they said, 'you are an old man. You have done with fortune, good or bad. But what sort of repute or position would your son <a id="id_2fnm176"/>Germanicus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn176" class="2fnnum pginternal">176</a> enjoy? At present they are promising you money and a household, and the pleasant shores of Campania. But when once Vespasian has seized the throne, neither he nor his friends nor even his army will feel their safety assured until the rival claimant is dead. They imprisoned Fabius Valens and meant to make use of him if a crisis occurred, but they found him too great an incubus. You may be sure that Antonius and Fuscus and that typical representative of the party, Mucianus, will have no choice but to kill you. Julius Caesar did not let Pompey live unmolested, nor Augustus <a id="id_2fnm177"/>Antony.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn177" class="2fnnum pginternal">177</a><a id="id_2page76"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="76"></a> Do you suppose that Vespasian's is a loftier disposition?

You must not disgrace them. Despair, at least, should nerve your courage. The troops are steadfast; you still enjoy the people's favour. Indeed, nothing worse can happen to you than what we are eager to face of our own free will. If we are defeated, we must die; if we surrender, we must die. All that matters is whether we breathe our last amid mockery and insult or bravely and with honour.'</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap67"/><span class="chapnum">67</span>But Vitellius was deaf to all courageous counsel. His mind was obsessed with pity for his wife and children, and an anxious fear that obstinate resistance might make the conqueror merciless towards them. He had also a <a id="id_2fnm180"/>mother,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn180" class="2fnnum pginternal">180</a> very old and infirm, but she had opportunely died a few days before and thus forestalled the ruin of her house. All she had got out of her son's principate was sorrow and a good name. On December 17 he heard the news that the legion and the Guards at Narnia had deserted him and surrendered to the enemy. He at once put on mourning and left the palace, surrounded by his sorrowful household. His small son was carried in a little litter, as though this had been his funeral. The populace <a id="id_2page77"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="77"></a>uttered untimely flatteries: the soldiers kept an ominous silence.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap68"/><span class="chapnum">68</span>On that day there was no one so indifferent to the tragedy of human life as to be unmoved by this spectacle. A Roman emperor, yesterday master of the inhabited world, had left the seat of his authority, and was now passing through the streets of the city, through the crowding populace, quitting the throne. Such a sight had never been seen or heard of before. The dictator, Caesar, had been the victim of sudden violence; Caligula of a secret conspiracy. Nero's had been a stealthy flight to some obscure country house under cover of night. Piso and Galba might almost be said to have fallen on the field of battle. But here was Vitellius—before the assembly of his own people, his own soldiers around him, with women even looking on—uttering a few sentences suitable to his miserable situation. He said it was in the interest of peace and of his country that he now resigned. He begged them only to retain his memory in their hearts and to take pity on his brother, his wife, and his little innocent children. As he said this, he held out his son to them and commended him, now to individuals, now to the whole assembly. At last tears choked his voice. Turning to the consul, Caecilius <a id="id_2fnm181"/>Simplex,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn181" class="2fnnum pginternal">181</a> who was standing by, he unstrapped his sword and offered to surrender it as a symbol of his power over the life and death of his subjects. The consul refused. The people in the assembly shouted 'No'. So he left them with the <a id="id_2page78"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="78"></a>intention of depositing the regalia in the Temple of Concord and then going to his brother's house. But he was faced with a still louder uproar. They refused to let him enter a private house, and shouted to him to return to the palace. They blocked every other way and only left the road leading into the Via Sacra <a id="id_2fnm182"/>open.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn182" class="2fnnum pginternal">182</a> Not knowing what else to do, Vitellius returned to the palace.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap69"/><span class="chapnum">69</span>A rumour of his abdication had preceded him, and Flavius Sabinus had sent written instructions to the Guards'<a id="id_2fnm183"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn183" class="2fnnum pginternal">183</a> officers to keep the men in hand. Thus the whole empire seemed to have fallen into Vespasian's lap. The chief senators, the majority of the knights, and the whole of the city garrison and the police came flocking to the house of Flavius Sabinus. There they heard the news of the popular enthusiasm for Vitellius and the threatening attitude of the German <a id="id_2fnm184"/>Guards.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn184" class="2fnnum pginternal">184</a> But Sabinus had gone too far to draw back, and when he showed hesitation, they all began to urge him to fight, each being afraid for his own safety if the Vitellians were to fall on them when they were disunited and consequently weaker. However, as so often happens on these occasions, every one offered to give <a id="id_2page79"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="79"></a>advice but few to share the danger. While Sabinus' Body Guard were marching down by the Fundane <a id="id_2fnm185"/>reservoir<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn185" class="2fnnum pginternal">185</a> they were attacked by some of the most determined Vitellians. The surprise was unpremeditated, but the Vitellians got the best of an unimportant skirmish. In the panic Sabinus chose what was at the moment the safest course, and occupied the summit of the <a id="id_2fnm186"/>Capitol,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn186" class="2fnnum pginternal">186</a> where his troops were joined by a few senators and knights. It is not easy to record their names, since after Vespasian's victory crowds of people claimed credit for this service to the party. There were even some women who endured the siege, the most famous of them being Verulana Gratilla, who had neither children nor relatives to attract her, but only her love of <a id="id_2fnm187"/>danger.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn187" class="2fnnum pginternal">187</a></p>
<p>The Vitellians, who were investing them, kept a half-hearted watch, and Sabinus was thus enabled to send for his own children and his nephew Domitian at dead of night, dispatching a courier by an unguarded route to tell the Flavian generals that he and his men were under siege, and would be in great straits unless they were rescued. All night, indeed, he was quite unmolested, and could have escaped with perfect safety. The Vitellian troops could face danger with spirit, but were much too careless in the task of keeping guard; <a id="id_2page80"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="80"></a>besides which a sudden storm of chilly rain interfered with their sight and hearing.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap70"/><span class="chapnum">70</span>At daybreak, before the two sides commenced hostilities, Sabinus sent Cornelius Martialis, who had been a senior centurion, to Vitellius with instructions to complain that the conditions were being violated; that he had evidently made a mere empty show of abdication, meant to deceive a number of eminent gentlemen. Else why had he gone from the meeting to his brother's house, which caught the eye from a conspicuous position overlooking the Forum, and not rather to his wife's on the Aventine. That was the proper course for a private citizen, anxious to avoid all pretension to supreme authority. But no, Vitellius had returned to the palace, the very stronghold of imperial majesty. From there he had launched a column of armed men, who had strewn with innocent dead the most crowded quarter of Rome, and even laid violent hands upon the Capitol. As for Sabinus himself, the messenger was to say, he was only a civilian, a mere member of the senate. While the issue was being decided between Vespasian and Vitellius by the engagement of legions, the capture of towns, the capitulation of cohorts; even when the provinces of Spain, of Germany, of Britain, had risen in revolt; he, though Vespasian's brother, had still remained faithful to his allegiance, until Vitellius, unasked, began to invite him to a conference. Peace and union, he was to remind him, serve the interest of the losers, and only the reputation of the winners. If Vitellius <a id="id_2page81"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="81"></a>regretted their compact, he ought not to take arms against Sabinus, whom he had treacherously deceived, and against Vespasian's son, who was still a mere boy. What was the good of killing one youth and one old man? He ought rather to march out against the legions and fight for the empire on the field. The result of the battle would decide all other questions.</p>
<p>Greatly alarmed, Vitellius replied with a few words in which he tried to excuse himself and throw the blame on his soldiers. 'I am too unassuming,' he said, 'to cope with their overpowering impatience.' He then warned Martialis to make his way out of the house by a secret passage, for fear that the soldiers should kill him as an ambassador of the peace to which they were so hostile. Vitellius himself was not in a position to issue orders or prohibitions; no longer an emperor, merely an excuse for war.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap71"/><span class="chapnum">71</span>Martialis had hardly returned to the Capitol when the furious soldiery arrived. They had no general to lead them: each was a law to himself. Their column marched at full speed through the Forum and past the temples overlooking it. Then in battle order they advanced up the steep hill in front of them, until they reached the lowest gates of the fortress on the Capitol. In old days there was a series of colonnades at the side of this slope, on the right as you go up. Emerging on to the roof of these, the besieged overwhelmed the Vitellians with showers of stones and tiles. The attacking party carried nothing but swords, and it seemed a long business to send for siege-engines and <a id="id_2page82"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="82"></a>missiles. So they flung torches into the <a id="id_2fnm188"/>nearest<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn188" class="2fnnum pginternal">188</a> colonnade and, following in the wake of the flames, would have burst through the burnt gates of the Capitol, if Sabinus had not torn down all the available statues—the monuments of our ancestors' glory—and built a sort of barricade on the very threshold. They then tried to attack the Capitol by two opposite approaches, one near the 'Grove of Refuge'<a id="id_2fnm189"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn189" class="2fnnum pginternal">189</a> and the other by the hundred steps which lead up to the Tarpeian Rock. This double assault came as a surprise. That by the Refuge was the closer and more vigorous. Nothing could stop the Vitellians, who climbed up by some contiguous houses built on to the side of the hill, which in the days of prolonged peace had been raised to such a height that their roofs were level with the floor of the Capitol. It is uncertain whether the buildings at this point were fired by the assailants or—as tradition prefers—by the besieged in trying to dislodge their enemies who had struggled up so far. The fire spread to the colonnades adjoining the temples, and then the 'eagles'<a id="id_2fnm190"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn190" class="2fnnum pginternal">190</a> supporting the roof, which were made of very old wood, caught the flames and fed them. And so the Capitol, with its doors fast shut, undefended and unplundered, was burnt to the ground.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap72"/><span class="chapnum">72</span>Since the foundation of the city no such deplorable and horrible disaster had ever befallen the people of<a id="id_2page83"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="83"></a> Rome. It was no case of foreign invasion. Had our own wickedness allowed, the country might have been enjoying the blessings of a benign Providence; and yet here was the seat of Jupiter Almighty—the temple solemnly founded by our ancestors as the pledge of their imperial greatness, on which not even <a id="id_2fnm191"/>Porsenna,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn191" class="2fnnum pginternal">191</a> when Rome surrendered, nor the Gauls, when they took it, had ever dared to lay rash hands—being brought utterly to ruin by the mad folly of two rival emperors!<a id="id_2fnm192"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn192" class="2fnnum pginternal">192</a> The Capitol had been burnt before in civil war,<a id="id_2fnm193"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn193" class="2fnnum pginternal">193</a> but that was the crime of private persons. Now it had been openly assaulted by the people of Rome and openly burnt by them. And what was the cause of war? what the recompense for such a disaster? Were we fighting for our country?</p>
<p>King Tarquinius Priscus had vowed to build this temple in the Sabine war, and had laid the foundations on a scale that suited rather his hope of the city's future greatness than the still moderate fortunes of the Roman people. Later Servius Tullius, with the aid of Rome's allies, and Tarquinius Superbus, with the spoils of the Volscians after the capture of Suessa <a id="id_2fnm194"/>Pometia,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn194" class="2fnnum pginternal">194</a> continued the building. But the glory of completing it was reserved for the days of freedom. After the expulsion of the kings, Horatius Pulvillus, <a id="id_2page84"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="84"></a>in his second <a id="id_2fnm195"/>consulship<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn195" class="2fnnum pginternal">195</a> dedicated this monument on such a magnificent scale, that in later days, with all her boundless wealth, Rome has been able to embellish but never to enlarge it. After an interval of four hundred and fifteen years, in the consulship of Lucius Scipio and Caius <a id="id_2fnm196"/>Norbanus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn196" class="2fnnum pginternal">196</a> it was burnt and rebuilt on the same site. Sulla after his victory undertook the task of restoring it, but did not dedicate it. This only was lacking to justify his title of 'Fortune's Favourite'.<a id="id_2fnm197"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn197" class="2fnnum pginternal">197</a> Much as the emperors did to it, the name of Lutatius <a id="id_2fnm198"/>Catulus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn198" class="2fnnum pginternal">198</a> still remained upon it up to the time of Vitellius.<a id="id_2fnm199"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn199" class="2fnnum pginternal">199</a> This was the temple that was now ablaze.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap73"/><span class="chapnum">73</span>The besieged suffered more panic than their assailants. The Vitellian soldiers lacked neither resource nor steadiness in moments of crisis. But on the other side the troops were terrified, the <a id="id_2fnm200"/>general<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn200" class="2fnnum pginternal">200</a> inert, and apparently so paralysed that he was practically deaf and dumb. He neither adopted others' plans nor formed any of his own, but only drifted about from place to place, attracted by the shouts of the enemy, contradicting all his own orders. The result was what always happens in a hopeless disaster: everybody gave orders and nobody obeyed them. At last they threw away their weapons and began to peer round for <a id="id_2page85"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="85"></a>a way of escape or some means of hiding. Then the Vitellians came bursting in, and with fire and sword made one red havoc. A few good soldiers dared to show fight and were cut to pieces. Of these the most notable were Cornelius <a id="id_2fnm201"/>Martialis,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn201" class="2fnnum pginternal">201</a> Aemilius <a id="id_2fnm202"/>Pacensis,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn202" class="2fnnum pginternal">202</a> Casperius Niger, and Didius Scaeva. Flavius Sabinus, who stood unarmed and making no attempt to escape, was surrounded together with the consul Quintius Atticus,<a id="id_2fnm203"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn203" class="2fnnum pginternal">203</a> whose empty title made him a marked man, as well as his personal vanity, which had led him to distribute manifestoes full of compliments to Vespasian and insults against Vitellius. The rest escaped by various means. Some disguised themselves as slaves: some were sheltered by faithful dependants: some hid among the baggage. Others again caught the Vitellians' password, by which they recognized each other, and actually went about demanding it and giving it when challenged, thus escaping under a cloak of effrontery.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap74"/><span class="chapnum">74</span>When the enemy first broke in, Domitian had taken refuge with the sacristan, and was enabled by the ingenuity of a freedman to escape among a crowd of worshippers in a linen <a id="id_2fnm204"/>dress,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn204" class="2fnnum pginternal">204</a> and to take refuge near the Velabrum with Cornelius Primus, one of his father's dependants. When his father came to the throne, Domitian pulled down the sacristan's lodging and <a id="id_2page86"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="86"></a>built a little chapel to Jupiter the Saviour with an altar, on which his adventures were depicted in marble relief. Later, when he became emperor, he dedicated a huge temple to Jupiter the Guardian with a statue of himself in the lap of the god.</p>
<p>Sabinus and Atticus were loaded with chains and taken to Vitellius, who received them without any language or looks of disfavour, much to the chagrin of those who wanted to see them punished with death and themselves rewarded for their successful labours. When those who stood nearest started an outcry, the dregs of the populace soon began to demand Sabinus' execution with mingled threats and flatteries. Vitellius came out on to the steps of the palace prepared to plead for him: but they forced him to desist. Sabinus was stabbed and riddled with wounds: his head was cut off and the trunk dragged away to the Ladder <a id="IIIchap75"/><span class="chapnum">75</span>of <a id="id_2fnm205"/>Sighs.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn205" class="2fnnum pginternal">205</a> Such was the end of a man who certainly merits no contempt. He had served his country for thirty-five years, and won credit both as civilian and soldier. His integrity and fairness were beyond criticism. He talked too much about himself, but this is the one charge which rumour could hint against him in the seven years when he was Governor of Moesia, and the twelve years during which he was Prefect of the City. At the end of his life some thought he showed a lack of enterprise, but many believed him <a id="id_2page87"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="87"></a>a moderate man, who was anxious to save his fellow citizens from bloodshed. In this, at any rate, all would agree, that before Vespasian became emperor the reputation of his house rested on Sabinus. It is said that Mucianus was delighted to hear of his murder, and many people maintained that it served the interests of peace by putting an end to the jealousy of two rivals, one of whom was the emperor's brother, while the other posed as his partner in the <a id="id_2fnm206"/>empire.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn206" class="2fnnum pginternal">206</a></p>
<p>When the people further demanded the execution of the consul, Vitellius withstood them. He had forgiven Atticus, and felt that he owed him a favour, for, when asked who had set fire to the Capitol, Atticus had taken the blame on himself, by which avowal—or was it a well-timed falsehood?—he had fixed all the guilt and odium on himself and exonerated the Vitellian party.</p>
