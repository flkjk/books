A rumour had been spread that our winter camps in Moesia and Pannonia were being blockaded by Sarmatians and Dacians:<a id="id_2fnm385"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn385" class="2fnnum pginternal">385</a> similar stories were fabricated about Britain: the Gauls began to think that the fortune of the Roman arms was the same all the world over. But above all, the burning of the Capitol led them to believe that the empire was coming to an end. 'Once in old days the Gauls had captured Rome, but her empire had stood firm since Jupiter's high-place was left unscathed. But now, <a id="id_2page163"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="163"></a>so the <a id="id_2fnm386"/>Druids<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn386" class="2fnnum pginternal">386</a> with superstitious folly kept dinning into their ears, this fatal fire was a sign of Heaven's anger, and meant that the Transalpine tribes were destined now to rule the world.' It was also persistently rumoured that the Gallic chieftains, whom Otho had sent to work against <a id="id_2fnm387"/>Vitellius,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn387" class="2fnnum pginternal">387</a> had agreed, before they parted, that if Rome sank under its internal troubles in an unbroken sequence of civil wars, they would not fail the cause of the Gallic freedom.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap55"/><span class="chapnum">55</span>Previous to the murder of Hordeonius <a id="id_2fnm388"/>Flaccus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn388" class="2fnnum pginternal">388</a> nothing had leaked out to arouse suspicions of a conspiracy, but when he had been assassinated, negotiations passed between Civilis and Classicus,<a id="id_2fnm389"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn389" class="2fnnum pginternal">389</a> who commanded the Treviran cavalry. Classicus was far above the rest both in birth and in wealth. He came of royal line and his stock was famous both in peace and war. It was his boast that his family had given Rome more enemies than allies. These two were now joined by Julius Tutor and Julius Sabinus, the one a Treviran, the other a Lingonian. Tutor had been appointed by Vitellius to watch the bank of the <a id="id_2fnm390"/>Rhine.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn390" class="2fnnum pginternal">390</a> Sabinus'<a id="id_2page164"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="164"></a> natural vanity was further inflamed by spurious pretensions of high birth, for he alleged that his great-grandmother's beauty had caught the fancy of Julius Caesar during the campaign in Gaul, and that they had committed adultery. These four tested the temper of the rest in private interviews, and having bound to the conspiracy those who were considered fit, they held a conference at Cologne in a private house, the general feeling in the city being hostile to such plans as theirs. A few of the Ubii and Tungri, indeed, attended, but the Treviri and Lingonians were the backbone of the conspiracy. Nor would they tolerate deliberation or delay. They vied with each other in protesting that Rome was distracted by internal quarrels; legions had been cut to pieces, Italy devastated, the city was on the point of being taken, while all her armies were occupied with wars of their own in different quarters. They need only garrison the Alps and then, when liberty had taken firm root, they could discuss together what limit each tribe should set to its exercise of power.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap56"/><span class="chapnum">56</span>All this was no sooner spoken than applauded. About the remnant of Vitellius' army they were in some doubt. Many held that they ought to be killed as being treacherous and insubordinate and stained with the blood of their generals. However, the idea of sparing them carried the day. To destroy all hope of pardon would only steel their obstinacy: it was much better to seduce them into alliance: only the generals need be killed; a guilty conscience and the hope of pardon would soon bring the rest flocking over <a id="id_2page165"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="165"></a>to their flag. Such was the tenor of their first meeting. Agitators were sent all over Gaul to stir up war. The conspirators themselves feigned loyalty to Vocula, hoping to catch him off his <a id="id_2fnm391"/>guard.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn391" class="2fnnum pginternal">391</a> There were, indeed, traitors who reported all this to Vocula, but he was not strong enough to crush the conspiracy, his legions being short-handed and unreliable. Between suspected troops on one side and secret enemies on the other, it seemed his best course under the circumstances to dissemble, as they were doing, and thus use their own weapons against them. So he marched down the river to Cologne. There he found Claudius Labeo, who after being taken prisoner, as described <a id="id_2fnm392"/>above,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn392" class="2fnnum pginternal">392</a> and relegated to the Frisii, had bribed his guards and escaped to Cologne. He promised that if Vocula would provide him with troops, he would go to the Batavi and win back the better part of their community to the Roman alliance. He was given a small force of horse and foot. Without venturing any attempt upon the Batavi, he attracted a few of the Nervii and <a id="id_2fnm393"/>Baetasii<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn393" class="2fnnum pginternal">393</a> to his standard, and proceeded to harass the Canninefates and Marsaci<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn393" class="2fnnum pginternal">393</a> more by stealth than open warfare.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap57"/><span class="chapnum">57</span>Lured by the treachery of the Gauls, Vocula marched out against his <a id="id_2fnm394"/>enemy.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn394" class="2fnnum pginternal">394</a> Not far from Vetera, Classicus and Tutor rode <a id="id_2fnm395"/>forward<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn395" class="2fnnum pginternal">395</a> on a pretext of scouting, <a id="id_2page166"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="166"></a>and ratified their compact with the German leaders. They were now for the first time separated from the legions, and entrenched themselves in a camp of their own. At this, Vocula loudly protested that Rome was not as yet so shattered by civil war as to earn the contempt of tribes like the Treviri and Lingones. She could still rely on loyal provinces and victorious armies, on the good fortune of the empire and the avenging hand of God. Thus it was that in former days Sacrovir and the <a id="id_2fnm396"/>Aedui,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn396" class="2fnnum pginternal">396</a> more lately and the Gallic provinces had each been crushed at a single battle. Now, again, these treaty-breakers must expect to face the same powers of Providence and Destiny. The sainted Julius and the sainted Augustus had understood these people better: it was Galba's reduction of the <a id="id_2fnm397"/>tribute<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn397" class="2fnnum pginternal">397</a> that had clothed them in enmity and pride. 'They are our enemies to-day because their yoke is easy: when they have been stripped and plundered they will be our friends.' After these spirited words, seeing that Classicus and Tutor still persisted in their treachery, he turned back and retired to Novaesium, while the Gauls encamped a couple of miles away. Thither the centurions and soldiers flocked to sell their souls. This was, indeed, an unheard <a id="id_2page167"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="167"></a>of villainy that Roman soldiers should swear allegiance to a foreign power, and offer as a pledge for this heinous crime either to kill or imprison their generals. Though many urged Vocula to escape, he felt that he must make a bold stand, so he summoned a meeting and spoke <a id="IVchap58"/><span class="chapnum">58</span>somewhat as follows:—'Never before have I addressed you with such feelings of anxiety for you, or with such indifference to my own fate. That plans are being laid for my destruction I am glad enough to hear: in such a parlous case as this I look for death as the end of all my troubles. It is for you that I feel shame and pity. It is not that a field of battle awaits you, for that would only accord with the laws of warfare and the just rights of combatants, but because Classicus hopes that with your hands he can make war upon the Roman people, and flourishes before you an oath of allegiance to the Empire of All Gaul. What though fortune and courage have deserted us for the moment, have we not glorious examples in the past? How often have not Roman soldiers chosen to die rather than be driven from their post? Often have our allies endured the destruction of their cities and given themselves and their wives and children to the flames, without any other reward for such an end save the name of honourable men. At this very moment Roman troops are enduring famine and siege at Vetera, and neither threats nor promises can move them, while we, besides arms and men and fine fortifications, have supplies enough to last through any length of war. Money, too—the other day there was enough even <a id="id_2page168"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="168"></a>for a donative, and whether you choose to say that it was given you by Vespasian or by Vitellius, at any rate you got it from a Roman Emperor. After all the engagements you have won, after routing the enemy at Gelduba, at Vetera, it would be shameful enough to shirk battle, but you have your trenches and your walls, and there are ways of gaining time until armies come flocking from the neighbouring provinces to your rescue. Granted that you dislike me; well, there are others to lead you, whether legate, tribune, centurion, and even private soldier. But do not let this portent be trumpeted over the whole world, that Civilis and Classicus are going to invade Italy with you in their train. Suppose the Germans and Gauls lead the way to the walls of Rome, will you turn your arms upon your fatherland? The mere thought of such a crime is horrible. Will you stand sentry for the Treviran Tutor? Shall a Batavian give you the signal for battle? Will you swell the ranks of German hordes? And what will be the issue of your crime, when the Roman legions take the field against you? Desertion upon desertion, treachery upon treachery! You will be drifting miserably between the old allegiance and the new, with the curse of Heaven on your heads. Almighty Jupiter, whom we have worshipped at triumph after triumph for eight hundred and twenty years; and Quirinus, Father of our Rome, if it be not your pleasure that under my command this camp be kept clean from the stain of dishonour, grant at the least, I humbly beseech ye, that it never be defiled with <a id="id_2page169"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="169"></a>the pollution of a Tutor or a Classicus; and to these soldiers of Rome give either innocence of heart or a speedy repentance before the harm is done.'</p>
<p><a id="IVchap59"/><span class="chapnum">59</span>The speech was variously received, with feelings fluctuating between hope, fear, and shame. Vocula withdrew and began to prepare for his end, but his freedmen and slaves prevented him from forestalling by his own hand a dreadful death. As it was, Classicus dispatched Aemilius Longinus, a deserter from the First legion, who quickly murdered him. For Herennius and Numisius imprisonment was thought sufficient. Classicus then assumed the uniform and insignia of a Roman general, and thus entered the camp. Hardened though he was to every kind of crime, words failed him,<a id="id_2fnm398"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn398" class="2fnnum pginternal">398</a> and he could only read out the oath. Those who were present swore allegiance to the Empire of All Gaul. He then gave high promotion to Vocula's assassin, and rewarded the others each according to the villainy of his service.</p>
<p>The command was now divided between Tutor and Classicus. Tutor at the head of a strong force besieged Cologne and forced the inhabitants and all the soldiers on the Upper Rhine to take the same oath of allegiance. At Mainz he killed the officers and drove away the camp-prefect, who had refused to swear. Classicus ordered all the greatest scoundrels among the deserters to go to Vetera and offer pardon to the besieged if they would yield to circumstances: otherwise there was no hope for them: they should suffer famine and sword <a id="id_2page170"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="170"></a>and every extremity. The messengers further cited their own example.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap60"/><span class="chapnum">60</span>Torn by a conflict of loyalty and hunger, the besieged vacillated between honour and disgrace. While they hesitated, all their sources of food, both usual and unusual, began to fail them. They had eaten their mules and horses and all the other animals which, though foul and unclean, their straits had forced into use. At last they took to grubbing up the shrubs and roots and the grass that grew between the stones, and became a very pattern of endurance in wretchedness, until at last they soiled their glory by a shameful end. Envoys were sent to Civilis begging him to save their lives. Even then he refused to receive their petition until they had sworn allegiance to All Gaul. He then negotiated for the plunder of the camp and sent guards, some to secure the money, servants and baggage, and others to conduct the men themselves out of the camp with empty hands. About five miles down the road their line was surprised by an ambush of Germans. The bravest fell on the spot; many were cut down in flight; the rest got back to camp. Civilis, indeed, complained that the Germans had criminally broken faith and rebuked them for it. There is no evidence to show whether this was a pretence or whether he was really unable to restrain his savage troops. The camp was plundered and burnt, and all who had survived the battle were devoured by the flames.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap61"/><span class="chapnum">61</span>When Civilis first took up arms against Rome he made a vow, such as is common with barbarians, to <a id="id_2page171"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="171"></a>let his ruddled <a id="id_2fnm399"/>hair<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn399" class="2fnnum pginternal">399</a> grow wild; now that he had at last accomplished the destruction of the legions he had it cut. It is said also that he put up some of the prisoners for his little son to shoot in sport with javelins and arrows. However that may be, he did not himself swear allegiance to All Gaul, nor did he force any of the Batavi to do so. He felt that he could rely on the strength of the Germans, and that if any quarrel arose with the Gauls about the empire, his fame would give him an advantage. Munius Lupercus, one of the Roman commanding-officers, was sent among other presents to Veleda, a virgin of the Bructeran tribe who wielded a wide-spread authority.<a id="id_2fnm400"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn400" class="2fnnum pginternal">400</a> It is an ancient custom in Germany to credit a number of women with prophetic powers, and with the growth of superstition these develop into goddesses. At this moment Veleda's influence was at its height, for she had prophesied the success of the Germans and the destruction of the Roman <a id="id_2fnm401"/>army.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn401" class="2fnnum pginternal">401</a> However, Lupercus was killed on the journey. A few of the centurions and officers who had been born in Gaul were detained as a security for good faith. The winter camps of the legions and of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry were all dismantled and burnt, with the sole exception of those at Mainz and <a id="id_2fnm402"/>Vindonissa.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn402" class="2fnnum pginternal">402</a></p>
<p><a id="id_2page172"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="172"></a><a id="IVchap62"/><span class="chapnum">62</span>The Sixteenth legion and the auxiliary troops who had surrendered with it now received orders to migrate from their quarters at Novaesium to Trier, and a date was fixed by which they had to leave their camp. They spent the meantime brooding on various anxieties, the cowards all shuddering at the precedent of the massacre at Vetera, the better sort covered with shame at their disgrace. 'What sort of a march would this be? Whom would they have to lead them? Everything would be decided by the will of those into whose hands they had put their lives.' Others, again, were quite indifferent to the disgrace, and simply stowed all their money and most cherished possessions about their persons, while many got their armour ready and buckled on their swords, as if for battle. While they were still busy with these preparations the hour struck for their departure, and it proved more bitter than they had expected. Inside the trenches their disgrace was not so noticeable. The open country and the light of day revealed their depth of shame. The emperors' medallions had been torn <a id="id_2fnm403"/>down<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn403" class="2fnnum pginternal">403</a> and their standards desecrated, while Gallic ensigns glittered all around them. They marched in silence, like a long funeral procession, led by Claudius Sanctus,<a id="id_2fnm404"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn404" class="2fnnum pginternal">404</a> a man whose sinister appearance—he had lost one eye—was only surpassed by his weakness of intellect. Their disgrace was doubled when they were joined by the First legion, who had left their camp at<a id="id_2page173"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="173"></a> Bonn. The famous news of their capture had spread, and all the people who shortly before had trembled at the very name of Rome, now came flocking out from fields and houses, and scattered far and wide in transports of joy at this unwonted sight. Their insulting glee was too much for 'The Picenum Horse'.<a id="id_2fnm405"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn405" class="2fnnum pginternal">405</a> Defying all Sanctus' threats and promises, they turned off to Mainz, and coming by chance upon Longinus, the man who killed Vocula, they slew him with a shower of javelins and thus made a beginning of future amends. The legions, without changing their route, came and camped before the walls of Trier.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap63"/><span class="chapnum">63</span>Highly elated by their success, Civilis and Classicus debated whether they should allow their troops to sack Cologne. Their natural savagery and lust for plunder inclined them to destroy the town, but policy forbade; and they felt that in inaugurating a new empire a reputation for clemency would be an asset. Civilis was also moved by the memory of a past service, for at the beginning of the outbreak his son had been arrested in Cologne, and they had kept him in honourable custody. However, the tribes across the Rhine were jealous of this rich and rising community, and held that the war could only be ended either by throwing the settlement open to all Germans without distinction or by destroying it and thereby dispersing<a id="id_2page174"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="174"></a> <a id="IVchap64"/><span class="chapnum">64</span>the Ubii together with its other inhabitants.<a id="id_2fnm406"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn406" class="2fnnum pginternal">406</a> Accordingly the <a id="id_2fnm407"/>Tencteri,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn407" class="2fnnum pginternal">407</a> their nearest neighbours across the Rhine, dispatched a deputation to lay a message before a public meeting of the town. This was delivered by the haughtiest of the delegates in some such terms as these:—'We give thanks to the national gods of Germany and above all others, to the god of war, that you are again incorporate in the German nation and the German name, and we congratulate you that you will now at last become free members of a free community. Until to-day the Romans had closed to us the roads and rivers, and almost the very air of heaven, to prevent all intercourse between us; or else they offered a still fouler insult to born warriors, that we should meet under supervision, unarmed and almost <a id="id_2fnm408"/>naked,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn408" class="2fnnum pginternal">408</a> and should pay for the privilege. Now, that our friendly alliance may be ratified for all eternity, we demand of you that you pull down those bulwarks of slavery, the walls of your town, for even wild beasts lose their spirit if you keep them caged: that you put to the sword every Roman on your soil, since tyrants are incompatible with freedom; that all the property of those killed form a common stock and no one be <a id="id_2page175"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="175"></a>allowed to conceal anything or to secure any private advantage. It must also be open both for us and for you to live on either river-bank, as our forefathers could in earlier days. As daylight is the natural heritage of all mankind, so the land of the world is free to all brave men. Resume again the customs and manners of your own country and throw off those luxurious habits which enslave Rome's subjects far more effectively than Roman arms. Then, grown simple and uncorrupt, you will forget your past slavery and either know none but equals or hold empire over others.'</p>
<p><a id="IVchap65"/><span class="chapnum">65</span>The townspeople took time to consider these proposals, and, feeling that their apprehensions for the future forbade them to assent, while their present circumstances forbade them to return a plain negative, they answered as follows: 'We have seized our first opportunity of freedom with more haste than prudence, because we wanted to join hands with you and all our other German kinsmen. As for our town-walls, seeing that the Roman armies are massing at this moment, it would be safer for us to heighten them than to pull them down. All the foreigners from Italy or the provinces who lived on our soil have either perished in the war or fled to their own homes. As for the original <a id="id_2fnm409"/>settlers<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn409" class="2fnnum pginternal">409</a>, who are united to us by ties of marriage, they and their offspring regard this as their home, and we do not think you are so unreason<a id="id_2page176"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="176"></a>able as to ask us to kill our parents and brothers and children. All taxes and commercial restrictions we remit. We grant you free entry without supervision, but you must come in daylight and unarmed, while these ties which are still strange and new are growing into a long-established custom. As arbitrators we will appoint Civilis and Veleda, and we will ratify our compact in their presence.'</p>
<p>Thus the Tencteri were pacified. A deputation was sent with presents to Civilis and Veleda, and obtained all that the people of Cologne desired. They were not, however, allowed to approach and speak to Veleda or even to see her, but were kept at a distance to inspire in them the greater awe. She herself lived at the top of a high tower, and one of her relatives was appointed to carry all the questions and answers like a mediator between God and man.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap66"/><span class="chapnum">66</span>Now that he had gained the accession of Cologne, Civilis determined to win over the neighbouring communities or to declare war in case of opposition. He reduced the <a id="id_2fnm410"/>Sunuci<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn410" class="2fnnum pginternal">410</a> and formed their fighting strength into cohorts, but then found his advance barred by Claudius <a id="id_2fnm411"/>Labeo<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn411" class="2fnnum pginternal">411</a> at the head of a hastily-recruited band of Baetasii, Tungri, and Nervii.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn411" class="2fnnum pginternal">411</a> He had secured the bridge over the Maas and relied on the strength of his position. A skirmish in the narrow defile proved indecisive, until the Germans swam across and took Labeo in the rear. At this point<a id="id_2page177"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="177"></a> Civilis by a bold move—or possibly by arrangement—rode into the lines of the Tungri and called out in a loud voice, 'Our object in taking up arms is not to secure empire for the Batavi and Treviri over other tribes. We are far from any such arrogance. Take us as allies. I am come to join you; whether as general or as private it is for you to choose.' This had a great effect on the common soldiers, who began to sheathe their swords. Then two of their chieftains, Campanus and Juvenalis, surrendered the entire tribe. Labeo escaped before he was surrounded. Civilis also received the allegiance of the Baetasii and Nervii, and added their forces to his own. His power was now immense, for all the Gallic communities were either terrified or ready to offer willing support.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap67"/><span class="chapnum">67</span>In the meantime, Julius <a id="id_2fnm412"/>Sabinus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn412" class="2fnnum pginternal">412</a> who had destroyed every memorial of the Roman <a id="id_2fnm413"/>alliance,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn413" class="2fnnum pginternal">413</a> assumed the title of Caesar and proceeded to hurry a large unwieldy horde of his tribesmen against the <a id="id_2fnm414"/>Sequani,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn414" class="2fnnum pginternal">414</a> a neighbouring community, faithful to Rome. The Sequani accepted battle: the good cause prospered: the Lingones were routed. Sabinus fled the field with the same rash haste with which he had plunged into battle. Wishing to spread a rumour of his death, he took refuge in a house and set fire to it, and was thus supposed to have perished by his own act. We shall, however, relate in due course the devices by which <a id="id_2page178"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="178"></a>he lay in hiding and prolonged his life for nine more years, and allude also to the loyalty of his friends and the memorable example set by his wife <a id="id_2fnm415"/>Epponina.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-16.htm.html#id_2fn415" class="2fnnum pginternal">415</a></p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00055"><a id="Ebb_Tide"/>The Ebb-tide of Revolt</h3>
<p>This success on the part of the Sequani checked the rising flood. The Gallic communities gradually came to their senses and began to remember their obligations as allies. In this movement the <a id="id_2fnm416"/>Remi<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn416" class="2fnnum pginternal">416</a> took the lead. They circulated a notice throughout Gaul, summoning a meeting of delegates to consider whether liberty or peace was the preferable alternative. <a id="IVchap68"/><span class="chapnum">68</span>At Rome, however, all these disasters were exaggerated, and Mucianus began to feel anxious. He had already appointed Annius Gallus and Petilius Cerialis to the chief command, and distinguished officers as they were, he was afraid the conduct of such a war might be too much for them. Moreover, he could not leave Rome without government, but he was afraid of Domitian's unbridled passions, while, as we have already seen,<a id="id_2fnm417"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn417" class="2fnnum pginternal">417</a> he suspected Antonius Primus and Arrius Varus. Varus, as commanding the Guards, still had the chief power and influence in his hands. Mucianus accordingly displaced him, but, as a compensation, made him Director of <a id="id_2page179"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="179"></a>the Corn-supply. As he had also to placate Domitian, who was inclined to support Varus, he appointed to the command of the Guards Arrecinus Clemens, who was connected with Vespasian's <a id="id_2fnm418"/>family<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn418" class="2fnnum pginternal">418</a> and very friendly with Domitian. He also impressed it upon Domitian that Clemens' father had filled this command with great distinction under Caligula: that his name and his character would both find favour with the troops, and that, although he was a member of the <a id="id_2fnm419"/>senate,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn419" class="2fnnum pginternal">419</a> he was quite able to fill both positions. He then chose his staff, some as being the most eminent men in the country, others as recommended by private influence.</p>
<p>Thus both Domitian and Mucianus made ready to start, but with very different feelings. Domitian was full of the sanguine haste of youth, while Mucianus kept devising delays to check this enthusiasm. He was afraid that if Domitian once seized control of an army, his youthful self-assurance and his bad advisers would lead him into action prejudicial both to peace and war. Three victorious legions, the Eighth, Eleventh, and Thirteenth;<a id="id_2fnm420"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn420" class="2fnnum pginternal">420</a> the Twenty-first—one of Vitellius' legions—and the Second, which had been newly enrolled, all started for the front, some by way of the Poenine and <a id="id_2fnm421"/>Cottian<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn421" class="2fnnum pginternal">421</a> Alps, others over the Graian<a id="id_2page180"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="180"></a> <a id="id_2fnm422"/>Alps.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn422" class="2fnnum pginternal">422</a> The Fourteenth was also summoned from Britain, and the Sixth and First from Spain.</p>
<p>The rumour that this force was on its way, combined with the present temper of the Gauls, inclined them to adopt a sober policy. Their delegates now met in the territory of the Remi, where they found the representatives of the Treviri awaiting them. One of these, Julius Valentinus, who was the keenest instigator of a hostile policy, delivered a set speech, in which he heaped spiteful aspersions on the Roman people, making all the charges which are usually brought against great empires. He was a clever agitator, whose mad rhetoric made him popular with the crowd. <a id="IVchap69"/><span class="chapnum">69</span>However, Julius Auspex, a chieftain of the Remi, enlarged upon the power of Rome and the blessings of peace. 'Any coward can begin a war,' he said, 'but it is the brave who run the risks of its conduct: and here are the legions already upon us.' Thus he restrained them, awakening a sense of duty in all the sager breasts, and appealing to the fears of the younger men. So, while applauding Valentinus' courage, they followed the advice of Auspex. The fact that in 's rising the Treviri and Lingones sided with Verginius is known to have told against them in Gaul. Many, too, were held back by tribal jealousy. They wanted to know where the head-quarters of the war would be, to whom were they to look for auspices and orders, and, if all went well, which town would be chosen as the seat of government. Thus dissension <a id="id_2page181"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="181"></a>preceded victory. They angrily magnified, some their great connexions, others their wealth and strength, others their antiquity, until they grew tired of discussing the future and voted for the existing state of things. Letters were written to the Treviri in the name of All Gaul, bidding them cease hostilities, suggesting, however, that pardon might be obtained, and that many were ready to plead their cause if they showed repentance. Valentinus opposed this mandate and made his tribesmen offer a deaf ear to it. He was always less anxious to organize a campaign than to make speeches on every possible occasion.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap70"/><span class="chapnum">70</span>The result was that neither the Treviri nor the Lingones nor the other rebel tribes behaved as if aware of the serious risks they were undertaking. Even the leaders did not act in concert. Civilis wandered over the wilds of the Belgic country, trying to catch or expel Claudius Labeo. Classicus ordinarily took his ease, apparently enjoying the fruits of empire. Even Tutor seemed in no hurry to garrison the Upper Rhine and block the Alpine passes. In the meantime, the Twenty-first legion made its way down from Vindonissa, while Sextilius <a id="id_2fnm423"/>Felix<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn423" class="2fnnum pginternal">423</a> advanced through Raetia with some auxiliary cohorts. These were joined by the 'Picked Horse',<a id="id_2fnm424"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn424" class="2fnnum pginternal">424</a> a force that had been raised by Vitellius and then deserted to Vespasian. This was commanded by Civilis' nephew, Julius Briganticus,<a id="id_2fnm425"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn425" class="2fnnum pginternal">425</a> for uncle and nephew hated each other <a id="id_2page182"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="182"></a>with all the aggravated bitterness of near relatives. Tutor swelled his force of Treviri with fresh levies from the Vangiones, Triboci, and Caeracates,<a id="id_2fnm426"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn426" class="2fnnum pginternal">426</a> and a stiffening of Roman veterans, both horse and foot, who had either been bribed or intimidated. These first cut up an auxiliary cohort sent forward by Sextilius Felix, but on the advance of the Roman army with its generals they loyally deserted to their old flag, and were followed by the Triboci, Vangiones, and Caeracates. Tutor, followed by his Treviri, avoided Mainz and fell back on <a id="id_2fnm427"/>Bingium,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn427" class="2fnnum pginternal">427</a> relying on his position there, as he had broken down the bridge over the river Nava. However, Sextilius' cohorts followed him up; some traitor showed them a ford; Tutor was routed. This disaster was a crushing blow to the Treviri. The rank and file dropped their weapons and took to the fields, while some of their chieftains, hoping it might be thought that they had been the first to lay down arms, took refuge among tribes who had never repudiated the Roman alliance. The legions which had been moved, as we saw <a id="id_2fnm428"/>above,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn428" class="2fnnum pginternal">428</a> from Novaesium and Bonn to Trier, now administered to themselves the oath of allegiance to Vespasian. This happened in Valentinus' absence. When he arrived in furious excitement, ready to spread universal <a id="id_2page183"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="183"></a>ruin and confusion, the legions withdrew into the friendly territory of the Mediomatrici.<a id="id_2fnm429"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn429" class="2fnnum pginternal">429</a> Valentinus and Tutor then led the Treviri forcibly back into the field, but first they killed the two Roman officers, Herennius and <a id="id_2fnm430"/>Numisius.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn430" class="2fnnum pginternal">430</a> By diminishing the hope of pardon they tried to cement their bond of crime.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap71"/><span class="chapnum">71</span>Such was the position when Petilius Cerialis reached Mainz. His arrival roused high hopes. He was himself thirsting for battle, and being always better at despising his enemy than at taking precautions, he fired his men by delivering a spirited harangue, promising that directly there was a chance of getting into touch with the enemy he would engage without delay. He dismissed the Gallic recruits to their homes with a message that the legions were enough for his task: the allies could resume their peaceful occupations, feeling assured that the war was practically ended, now that Roman troops had taken it in hand. This action rendered the Gauls all the more tractable. They made less difficulty about the war-tax, now that they had got their men back again, while his disdain only sharpened their sense of duty. On the other side, when Civilis and Classicus heard of Tutor's defeat, the destruction of the Treviri, and the universal success of the Roman arms, they fell into a panic, hastily mobilized their own scattered forces, and kept sending messages to Valentinus not to risk a decisive battle. This only hastened Cerialis' movements. He sent <a id="id_2page184"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="184"></a>guides to the legions stationed in the country of the Mediomatrici to lead them by the shortest route on the enemy's rear. Then, assembling all the troops to be found in <a id="id_2fnm431"/>Mainz<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn431" class="2fnnum pginternal">431</a> together with his own force, he marched in three days to <a id="id_2fnm432"/>Rigodulum.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn432" class="2fnnum pginternal">432</a> Here, on a spot protected by the mountains on one side and the Moselle on the other, Valentinus had already taken his stand with a large force of Treviri. His camp had been strengthened with trenches and stone barricades, but these fortifications had no terrors for the Roman general. He ordered the infantry to force the position in front, while the cavalry were to ascend the hill. Valentinus' hurriedly assembled forces filled him with contempt, for he knew that whatever advantage their position might give them, the superior morale of his men would outweigh it. A short delay was necessary while the cavalry climbed the hill, exposed to the enemy's fire. But when the fight began, the Treviri tumbled headlong down the hill like a house falling. Some of our cavalry, who had ridden round by an easier gradient, captured several Belgic chieftains, including their general, Valentinus.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap72"/><span class="chapnum">72</span>On the next day Cerialis entered Trier. The troops clamoured greedily for its destruction. 'It was the native town of Classicus and of Tutor: these were the men who had wickedly entrapped and slaughtered the legions. Its guilt was far worse than that of Cremona, which had been wiped off the face of Italy <a id="id_2page185"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="185"></a>for causing the victors a single night's delay. Was the chief seat of the rebellion to be left standing untouched on the German frontier, glorying in the spoil of Roman armies and the blood of Roman generals?<a id="id_2fnm433"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn433" class="2fnnum pginternal">433</a> The plunder could go to the Imperial Treasury. It would be enough for them to see the rebel town in smoking ruins; that would be some compensation for the destruction of so many camps.' Cerialis was afraid of soiling his reputation if it was said that he gave his men a taste for cruelty and riot, so he suppressed their indignation. They obeyed him, too, for now that civil war was done with, there was less insubordination on foreign service. Their thoughts were now distracted by the pitiful plight of the legions who had been summoned from the country of the <a id="id_2fnm434"/>Mediomatrici.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn434" class="2fnnum pginternal">434</a> Miserably conscious of their guilt, they stood with eyes rooted to the ground. When the armies met, they raised no cheer: they had no answer for those who offered comfort and encouragement: they skulked in their tents, shunning the light of day. It was not fear of punishment so much as the shame of their disgrace which thus overwhelmed them. Even the victorious army showed their bewilderment: hardly venturing to make an audible petition, they craved pardon for them with silent tears. At length Cerialis soothed their alarm. He insisted that all disasters due to dissension between officers and men, or to the enemy's guile, were to be regarded as 'acts <a id="id_2page186"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="186"></a>of destiny'. They were to count this as their first day of service and sworn <a id="id_2fnm435"/>allegiance.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn435" class="2fnnum pginternal">435</a> Neither he nor the emperor would remember past misdeeds. He then gave them quarters in his own camp, and sent round orders that no one in the heat of any quarrel should taunt a fellow soldier with mutiny or defeat.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap73"/><span class="chapnum">73</span>Cerialis next summoned the Treviri and Lingones, and addressed them as follows: 'Unpractised as I am in public speaking, for it is only on the field that I have asserted the superiority of Rome, yet since words have so much weight with you, and since you distinguish good and bad not by the light of facts but by what agitators tell you, I have decided to make a few remarks, which, as the war is practically over, are likely to be more profitable to the audience than to ourselves. Roman generals and officers originally set foot in your country and the rest of Gaul from no motives of ambition, but at the call of your ancestors, who were worn almost to ruin by dissension. The Germans whom one party summoned to their aid had forced the yoke of slavery on allies and enemies alike. You know how often we fought against the Cimbri and the Teutons, with what infinite pains and with what striking success our armies have undertaken German wars. All that is notorious. And to-day it is not to protect Italy that we have occupied the Rhine, but to prevent some second Ariovistus making himself <a id="id_2page187"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="187"></a>master of All <a id="id_2fnm436"/>Gaul.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn436" class="2fnnum pginternal">436</a> Do you imagine that Civilis and his Batavi and the other tribes across the Rhine care any more about you than their ancestors cared about your fathers and grandfathers? The Germans have always had the same motives for trespassing into Gaul—their greed for gain and their desire to change homes with you. They wanted to leave their marshes and deserts, and to make themselves masters of this magnificently fertile soil and of you who live on it. Of course they use specious pretexts and talk about liberty. No one has ever wanted to enslave others and play the tyrant without making use of the very same phrases.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap74"/><span class="chapnum">74</span>'Tyranny and warfare were always rife throughout the length and breadth of Gaul, until you accepted Roman government. Often as we have been provoked, we have never imposed upon you any burden by right of conquest, except what was necessary to maintain peace. Tribes cannot be kept quiet without troops. You cannot have troops without pay; and you cannot raise pay without taxation. In every other respect you are treated as our equals. You frequently command our legions yourselves: you govern this and other provinces yourselves. We have no exclusive privileges. Though you live so far away, you enjoy the blessings of a good emperor no less than we do, <a id="id_2page188"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="188"></a>whereas the tyrant only oppresses his nearest neighbours. You must put up with luxury and greed in your masters, just as you put up with bad crops or excessive rain, or any other natural disaster. Vice will last as long as mankind. But these evils are not continual. There are intervals of good government, which make up for them. You cannot surely hope that the tyranny of Tutor and Classicus would mean milder government, or that they will need less taxation for the armies they will have to raise to keep the Germans and Britons at bay. For if the Romans were driven out—which Heaven forbid—what could ensue save a universal state of intertribal warfare? During eight hundred years, by good fortune and good organization, the structure of empire has been consolidated. It cannot be pulled down without destroying those who do it. And it is you who would run the greatest risk of all, since you have gold and rich resources, which are the prime causes of war. You must learn, then, to love and foster peace and the city of Rome in which you, the vanquished, have the same rights as your conquerors. You have tried both conditions. Take warning, then, that submission and safety are better than rebellion and ruin.' By such words as these he quieted and reassured his audience, who had been afraid of more rigorous measures.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap75"/><span class="chapnum">75</span>While the victors were occupying Trier, Civilis and Classicus sent a letter to Cerialis, the gist of which was that Vespasian was dead, though the news was being suppressed: Rome and Italy were exhausted by civil <a id="id_2page189"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="189"></a>war: Mucianus and Domitian were mere names with no power behind them: if Cerialis desired to be emperor of All Gaul, they would be satisfied with their own territory: but if he should prefer battle, that, too, they would not deny him. Cerialis made no answer to Civilis and Classicus, but sent the letter and its bearer to Domitian.</p>
<p>The enemy now approached Trier from every quarter in detached bands, and Cerialis was much criticized for allowing them to unite, when he might have cut them off one by one. The Roman army now threw a trench and rampart round their camp, for they had rashly settled in it without seeing to the fortifications. <a id="IVchap76"/><span class="chapnum">76</span>In the German camp different opinions were being keenly debated. Civilis contended that they should wait for the tribes from across the Rhine, whose arrival would spread a panic sufficient to crush the enfeebled forces of the Romans. The Gauls, he urged, were simply a prey for the winning side and, as it was, the Belgae, who were their sole strength, had declared for him or were at least sympathetic. Tutor maintained that delay only strengthened the Roman force, since their armies were converging from every quarter. 'They have brought one legion across from Britain, others have been summoned from Spain, or are on their way from <a id="id_2fnm437"/>Italy.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn437" class="2fnnum pginternal">437</a> Nor are they raw recruits, but experienced veterans, while the Germans, on whose aid we rely, are subject to no discipline or control, but do whatever they like. You can only <a id="id_2page190"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="190"></a>bribe them with presents of money, and the Romans have the advantage of us there: besides, however keen to fight, a man always prefers peace to danger, so long as the pay is the same. But if we engage them at once, Cerialis has nothing but the remnants of the German <a id="id_2fnm438"/>army,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn438" class="2fnnum pginternal">438</a> who have sworn allegiance to the Gallic Empire. The very fact that they have just won an unexpected victory over Valentinus' undisciplined <a id="id_2fnm439"/>bands<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn439" class="2fnnum pginternal">439</a> serves to confirm them and their general in imprudence. They will venture out again and will fall, not into the hands of an inexperienced boy, who knows more about making speeches than war, but into the hands of Civilis and Classicus, at the sight of whom they will recall their fears and their flights and their famine, and remember how often they have had to beg their lives from their captors. Nor, again, is it any liking for the Romans that keeps back the Treviri and Lingones: they will fly to arms again, when once their fears are dispelled.' Classicus finally settled the difference of opinion by declaring for Tutor's policy, and they promptly proceeded to carry it out.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap77"/><span class="chapnum">77</span>The Ubii and Lingones were placed in the centre, the Batavian cohorts on the right, and on the left the Bructeri and Tencteri. Advancing, some by the hills and some by the path between the road and the <a id="id_2fnm440"/>river,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn440" class="2fnnum pginternal">440</a> <a id="id_2page191"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="191"></a> they took us completely by surprise. So sudden was their onslaught that Cerialis, who had not spent the night in camp, was still in bed when he heard almost simultaneously that the fighting had begun and that the day was lost. He cursed the messengers for their cowardice until he saw the whole extent of the disaster with his own eyes. The camp had been forced, the cavalry routed, and the bridge over the Moselle, leading to the outskirts of the town, which lay between him and his army,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn440" class="2fnnum pginternal">440</a> was held by the enemy. But confusion had no terrors for Cerialis. Seizing hold on fugitives, flinging himself without any armour into the thick of the fire, he succeeded by his inspired imprudence and the assistance of the braver men in retaking the bridge. Leaving a picked band to hold it, he hurried back to the camp, where he found that the companies of the legions which had surrendered at Bonn and <a id="id_2fnm441"/>Novaesium<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn441" class="2fnnum pginternal">441</a> were all broken up, few men were left at their posts, and the eagles were all but surrounded by the enemy. He turned on them in blazing anger, 'It is not Flaccus or Vocula that you are deserting. There is no "treason" about me. I have done nothing to be ashamed of, except that I was rash enough to believe that you had forgotten your Gallic ties and awakened to the memory of your Roman allegiance. Am I to be numbered with<a id="id_2page192"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="192"></a> Numisius and <a id="id_2fnm442"/>Herennius?<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn442" class="2fnnum pginternal">442</a> Then you can say that all your generals have fallen either by your hands or the enemy's. Go and tell the news to Vespasian, or rather, to Civilis and Classicus—they are nearer at hand—that you have deserted your general on the field of battle. There will yet come legions who will not leave me unavenged or you unpunished.'</p>
