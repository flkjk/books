The sailors of the fleet at Ravenna were mostly drawn from the provinces of Dalmatia and Pannonia, which were both held for Vespasian, and while they were still wavering, the admiral, Lucilius Bassus, decided them in favour of the Flavian party. Choosing the night-time for their treason, the conspirators assembled at head-quarters without the knowledge of the other sailors. Bassus, who was either ashamed or uncertain of their success, awaited developments in his house. Amid great disturbance the ships' captains attacked the images of Vitellius and cut down the few men who offered any resistance. The rest of the fleet were glad enough of a change, and their sympathies soon came round to Vespasian. Then Lucilius appeared and publicly claimed responsibility. The fleet appointed Cornelius <a id="id_2fnm48"/>Fuscus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-10.htm.html#id_2fn48" class="2fnnum pginternal">48</a> as their admiral, and he came hurrying on to the scene. Bassus was put under honourable arrest and conveyed with an escort of Liburnian <a id="id_2fnm49"/>cruisers<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-10.htm.html#id_2fn49" class="2fnnum pginternal">49</a> to <a id="id_2fnm50"/>Atria,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-10.htm.html#id_2fn50" class="2fnnum pginternal">50</a> where he was imprisoned by Vibennius Rufinus, who commanded a regiment of auxiliary horse in garrison there. However, he was soon set free on the intervention of Hormus, one of the emperor's freedmen. For he, too, ranked as a general.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap13"/><span class="chapnum">13</span>When the news that the navy had gone over became known, Caecina, carefully selecting a moment when the camp was deserted, and the men had all gone to their various duties, summoned to head-quarters the senior centurions and a few of the soldiers. He then proceeded <a id="id_2page23"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="23"></a>to praise the spirit and the strength of Vespasian's party: 'they themselves had been deserted by the fleet; they were cramped for supplies; Spain and Gaul were against them; Rome could not be trusted.' In every way he exaggerated the weakness of Vitellius' position. Eventually, when some of his accomplices had given the cue and the rest were dumbfoundered by his change of front, he made them all swear allegiance to Vespasian. Immediately the <a id="id_2fnm51"/>portraits<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-10.htm.html#id_2fn51" class="2fnnum pginternal">51</a> of Vitellius were torn down and messengers dispatched to Antonius. However, when the treason got abroad in the camp, and the men returning to head-quarters saw Vespasian's name on the standards and Vitellius' portraits scattered on the ground, at first there was an ominous silence: then with one voice they all vented their feelings. Had the pride of the German army sunk so low that without a battle and without a blow they should let their hands be shackled and render up their arms? What had they against them? None but defeated troops. The only sound legions of Otho's army, the First and the Fourteenth, Vespasian had not got, and even those they had routed and cut to pieces on that same field. And all for what? That these thousands of fighting men should be handed over like a drove of slaves to Antonius, the convict!<a id="id_2fnm52"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-10.htm.html#id_2fn52" class="2fnnum pginternal">52</a> 'Eight legions, forsooth, are to follow the lead of one miserable fleet. Such is the pleasure of Bassus and Caecina. They have robbed the emperor of his home, his estate, and all his wealth, and now they want to take away his troops.<a id="id_2page24"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="24"></a> We have never lost a man nor shed a drop of blood. The very Flavians will despise us. What answer can we give when they question us about our victory or our defeat?'</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap14"/><span class="chapnum">14</span>Thus they shouted one and all as their indignation urged them. Led by the Fifth legion, they replaced the portraits of Vitellius and put Caecina in irons. They selected Fabius Fabullus, commanding the Fifth legion, and the camp-prefect, Cassius Longus, to lead them. Some marines who arrived at this point from three Liburnian <a id="id_2fnm53"/>cruisers,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-10.htm.html#id_2fn53" class="2fnnum pginternal">53</a> quite innocent and unaware of what had happened, were promptly butchered.

<h3 id="pgepubid00037"><a id="The_Engagement"/>The Engagement near Cremona</h3>
<p><a id="IIIchap15"/><span class="chapnum">15</span>When Antonius heard of this he determined to attack the enemy while they were still at variance and their forces divided. The Vitellian generals would soon recover their authority and the troops their discipline, and confidence would come if the two divisions were allowed to join. He guessed also that Fabius Valens had already started from Rome and would hasten his march when he heard of Caecina's <a id="id_2page25"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="25"></a>treachery. Valens was loyal to Vitellius and an experienced soldier. There was good reason, besides, to fear an attack on the side of Raetia from an immense force of German irregulars. Vitellius had already summoned auxiliaries from Britain, Gaul, and Spain in sufficient numbers to blight their chances utterly, had not Antonius in fear of this very prospect forestalled the victory by hurriedly forcing an engagement. In two days he marched his whole force from Verona to <a id="id_2fnm56"/>Bedriacum.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-10.htm.html#id_2fn56" class="2fnnum pginternal">56</a> On the next <a id="id_2fnm57"/>day<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-10.htm.html#id_2fn57" class="2fnnum pginternal">57</a> he left his legions behind to fortify the camp, and sent out his auxiliary infantry into territory belonging to Cremona, to taste the joys of plundering their compatriots under pretext of collecting supplies. To secure greater freedom for their depredations, he himself advanced at the head of four thousand cavalry eight miles along the road from Bedriacum. The scouts, as is usual, turned their attention further afield.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap16"/><span class="chapnum">16</span>About eleven in the morning a mounted scout galloped up with the news that the enemy were at hand; there was a small body in advance of the rest, but the noise of an army in movement could be heard over the country-side. While Antonius was debating what he ought to do, Arrius Varus, who was greedy to distinguish himself, galloped out with the keenest of the troopers and charged the Vitellians, inflicting only slight loss; for, on the arrival of reinforcements, the tables were turned and those who had been hottest in pursuit were now hindmost in the rout. Their <a id="id_2page26"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="26"></a>haste had no sanction from Antonius, who had foreseen what would happen. Encouraging his men to engage with brave hearts, he drew off the cavalry on to each flank and left a free passage in the centre to receive Varus and his troopers. Orders were sent to the legions to arm and signals were displayed to the foraging party, summoning them to cease plundering and join the battle by the quickest possible path. Meanwhile Varus came plunging in terror into the middle of their ranks, spreading confusion among them. The fresh troops were swept back along with the wounded, themselves sharing the panic and sorely embarrassed by the narrowness of the road.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap17"/><span class="chapnum">17</span>In all the confusion of the rout Antonius never for a moment forgot what befitted a determined general and a brave soldier. Staying the panic-stricken, checking the fugitives, wherever the fight was thickest, wherever he saw a gleam of hope, he schemed, he fought, he shouted, always conspicuous to his own men and a mark for the enemy. At last, in the heat of his impatience, he thrust through with a lance a standard-bearer, who was in full flight, then seized the standard and turned it against the enemy. Whereupon for very shame a few of his troopers, not more than a hundred, made a stand. The nature of the ground helped them. The road there was narrower; a stream barred their way, and the bridge was broken; its depth was uncertain and the steep banks checked their flight. Thus necessity or chance restored their fallen fortunes. Forming in close order, they received <a id="id_2page27"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="27"></a>the Vitellians' reckless and disordered charge, and at once flung them into confusion. Antonius pressed hard on the fugitives and cut down all who blocked his path. The others followed each his inclination, rifling the dead, capturing prisoners, seizing arms and horses. Meanwhile, summoned by their shouts of triumph, those who had just now been in full flight across the fields came hurrying back to share the victory.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap18"/><span class="chapnum">18</span>Four miles from Cremona they saw the standards of the Rapax and Italian legions gleaming in the sun. They had marched out thus far under cover of their cavalry's original success. When fortune turned against them, they neither opened their ranks to receive the routed troops nor marched out to attack the enemy, who were wearied with fighting and their long pursuit. While all went well the Vitellians did not miss their general, but in the hour of danger they realized their loss. The victorious cavalry came charging into their wavering line, and at the same time Vipstanus Messala arrived with the Moesian auxiliaries and a good number of men from the legions, who had kept up with the pace of their forced <a id="id_2fnm58"/>march.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-10.htm.html#id_2fn58" class="2fnnum pginternal">58</a> These combined forces broke the opposing column, and the proximity of Cremona's sheltering walls gave the Vitellians more hope of refuge and less stomach for resistance.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00038"><a id="The_Fate"/>The Fate of Cremona</h3>
<p>Antonius did not follow up his advantage. He realized that, although the issue had been successful, the battle had long been doubtful, and had cost the troopers and their horses many wounds and much hard fighting. <a id="IIIchap19"/><span class="chapnum">19</span>As evening fell, the whole strength of the Flavian army arrived. They had marched among heaps of corpses, and the still reeking traces of slaughter, and now, feeling that the war was over, they clamoured to advance at once on Cremona and either receive its submission or take it by storm. This sounded well for public utterance, but each man in his heart was thinking, 'We could easily rush a city on the plain. In a night-assault men are just as brave and have a better chance of plunder. If we wait for day it will be all peace and petitions, and what shall we get for our wounds and our labours? A reputation for mercy! There's no money in that. All the wealth of Cremona will find its way into the officers' pockets. Storm a city, and the plunder goes to the soldiers: if it surrenders, the generals get it.' They refused to listen to their centurions and tribunes and drowned their voices in a rattle of arms, swearing they would break their orders unless they were led out. <a id="IIIchap20"/><span class="chapnum">20</span>Antonius then went round among the companies, where his authoritative bearing obtained silence. He assured them that he had no wish to rob them of the glory and the reward they so well deserved. 'But,' he said, 'an army and a general have different functions. It is right that soldiers <a id="id_2page29"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="29"></a>should be greedy for battle, but the general often does more good not by temerity but by foresight, deliberation and delay. I have done all I could to aid your victory with my sword: now I will serve you by the general's proper arts of calculation and strategy. The risks that face us are obvious. It is night; we know nothing of the lie of the city; the enemy are behind the walls; everything favours an ambush. Even if the gates were open, we cannot safely enter except by day and after due reconnoitring. Are you going to begin storming the town when you cannot possibly see where the ground is level and how high the walls are? How do you know whether to assault it with engines and showers of missiles, or with penthouses and shelters?'<a id="id_2fnm59"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn59" class="2fnnum pginternal">59</a> Then he turned to individuals, asking one after another whether they had brought hatchets and pick-axes and other implements for storming a town. When they answered no, 'Well,' he said, 'could any troops possibly break through walls or undermine them with nothing but swords and javelins? Suppose it proves necessary to construct a mound and to shelter ourselves with mantlets and fascines,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn59" class="2fnnum pginternal">59</a> are we going to stand idle like a lot of helpless idiots, gaping at the height of the enemy's towers and ramparts? Why not rather wait one night till our siege-train arrives and then carry the victory by force?' So saying, he sent the camp-followers and servants with the freshest of the troopers back to Bedriacum to bring up supplies and whatever else was wanted.</p>
<p><a id="id_2page30"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="30"></a><a id="IIIchap21"/><span class="chapnum">21</span>The soldiers indeed chafed at this and mutiny seemed imminent, when some of the mounted scouts, who had ridden right up to the walls, captured a few stragglers from Cremona, and learnt from them that six Vitellian legions and the whole Hostilia army had that very day covered thirty miles, and, hearing of their comrades' defeat, were already arming for battle and would be on them immediately. This alarming news cured their obstinate deafness to the general's advice. He ordered the Thirteenth legion to take up their position on the raised Postumian high-road. In touch with them on the left wing in the open country were the Seventh Galbian, beside whom stood the Seventh Claudian, so placed that their front was protected by a ditch. On the right wing were the Eighth, drawn up along an open cross-road, and next to them the Third, distributed among some thick clumps of trees. Such, at any rate, was the order of the eagles and standards. In the darkness the soldiers were confused and took their places at random. The band of <a id="id_2fnm60"/>Guards<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn60" class="2fnnum pginternal">60</a> was next to the Third, and the auxiliaries on the wings, while the cavalry were disposed in support round the flanks and the rear. Sido and Italicus with their picked band of <a id="id_2fnm61"/>Suebi<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn61" class="2fnnum pginternal">61</a> fought in the front line.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap22"/><span class="chapnum">22</span>For the Vitellians the right course was to rest at Cremona and recuperate their strength with food and a night's rest, and then on the next day to crush and <a id="id_2page31"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="31"></a>rout the Flavians when they were stiff with cold and weak from hunger. But they had no general;<a id="id_2fnm62"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn62" class="2fnnum pginternal">62</a> they had no plan. Though it was nearly nine at night they flung themselves upon the Flavians, who were standing steady in their places to receive them. In their fury and the darkness the Vitellian line was so disordered that one can hardly venture to describe the disposition of their troops. However, it has been stated that the Fourth Macedonian legion were on the right flank; in the centre were the Fifth and Fifteenth with the detachments of the Ninth, the Second and the Twentieth from Britain; the Sixteenth, the Twenty-second, and the First formed the left wing. The men of the Rapax and Italian <a id="id_2fnm63"/>legions<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn63" class="2fnnum pginternal">63</a> were distributed among all the companies.<a id="id_2fnm64"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn64" class="2fnnum pginternal">64</a> The cavalry and auxiliaries picked their own position. All night the battle raged with varying fortune, never decided, always savagely contested. Disaster threatened now one side, now the other. Courage, strength were of little use: their eyes could not even see in front of them. Both sides were armed alike; the watchwords, constantly demanded, soon became known; the standards were all in confusion, as they were captured and carried off from one band to another. The Seventh legion, raised recently by Galba, suffered most severely. Six of the senior centurions fell and several <a id="id_2page32"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="32"></a>standards were lost. They nearly lost their eagle too, but it was rescued by the bravery of the senior centurion, named Atilius Verus, who after great slaughter of the enemy fell finally himself.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap23"/><span class="chapnum">23</span>Antonius had meanwhile called up the Guards to reinforce his wavering line. Taking up the fight, they repulsed the enemy, only to be repulsed in their turn. For the Vitellian artillery, which had at first been scattered all along the line, and had been discharged upon the bushes without hurting the enemy, was now massed upon the high-road, and swept the open space in front. One immense engine in particular, which belonged to the Fifteenth, mowed down the Flavian line with huge stones. The slaughter thus caused would have been enormous, had not two of the Flavian soldiers performed a memorable exploit. Concealing their identity by snatching up shields from among the enemy's <a id="id_2fnm65"/>dead,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn65" class="2fnnum pginternal">65</a> they cut the ropes which suspended the weights of the engine. They fell immediately, riddled with wounds, and so their names have perished. But of their deed there is no doubt.</p>
<p>Fortune had favoured neither side when, as the night wore on, the moon rose and threw a deceptive glamour over the field of battle. Shining from behind the Flavians the moon was in their favour. It magnified the shadows of their men and horses so that the enemy took the shadow for the substance, and their <a id="id_2page33"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="33"></a>missiles were misdirected and fell short. The Vitellians, on the other hand, had the moon shining full on them and were an easy mark for the Flavians, shooting as it were out of <a id="id_2fnm66"/>cover.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn66" class="2fnnum pginternal">66</a></p>
<p><a id="IIIchap24"/><span class="chapnum">24</span>Thus being enabled to recognize his own men, and to be recognized by them, Antonius appealed to some by taunting their honour, to many by words of praise and encouragement, to all by promising hope of reward. He asked the Pannonian legions why they had drawn their swords again. Here on this field they could regain their glory and wipe out the stain of their former <a id="id_2fnm67"/>disgrace.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn67" class="2fnnum pginternal">67</a> Then turning to the Moesian troops, who were the chief promoters of the <a id="id_2fnm68"/>war,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn68" class="2fnnum pginternal">68</a> he told them it was no good challenging the Vitellians with verbal threats, if they could not bear to face them and their blows. Thus he addressed each legion as he reached it. To the Third he spoke at greater length, reminding them of their victories both old and new. Had they not under Mark Antony defeated the <a id="id_2fnm69"/>Parthians<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn69" class="2fnnum pginternal">69</a> and the Armenians under <a id="id_2fnm70"/>Corbulo?<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn70" class="2fnnum pginternal">70</a> Had they not but lately crushed the <a id="id_2fnm71"/>Sarmatians?<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn71" class="2fnnum pginternal">71</a> Then he turned in fury on the Guards. 'Peasants that you are,' he shouted, 'have you another emperor, another camp waiting to shelter you, if you are defeated? There in the enemy's line are your standards <a id="id_2page34"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="34"></a>and your arms: defeat means death and—no, you have drained disgrace already to the dregs.'</p>
<p>These words roused cheers on all sides, and the Third, following the Syrian <a id="id_2fnm72"/>custom,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn72" class="2fnnum pginternal">72</a> saluted the rising sun. <a id="IIIchap25"/><span class="chapnum">25</span>Thus arose a casual rumour—or possibly it was suggested by the general's ingenuity—that Mucianus had arrived, and that the two armies were cheering each other. On they pressed, feeling they had been reinforced. The Vitellian line was more ragged now, for, having no general to marshal them, their ranks now filled, now thinned, with each alternation of courage and fear. As soon as Antonius saw them waver, he kept thrusting at them in massed column. The line bent and then broke, and the inextricable confusion of wagons and siege-engines prevented their rallying. The victorious troops scattered along the cross-road in headlong pursuit.</p>
<p>The slaughter was marked by one peculiar horror. A son killed his father. I give the facts and names on the authority of Vipstanus Messala.<a id="id_2fnm73"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn73" class="2fnnum pginternal">73</a> One Julius Mansuetus, a Spaniard who had joined the legion Rapax, had left a young son at home. This boy subsequently grew up and enlisted in the Seventh legion, raised by <a id="id_2fnm74"/>Galba.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn74" class="2fnnum pginternal">74</a> Chance now sent his father in his way, and he felled him to the ground. While he was ransacking the dying man, they recognized each other. Flinging his arms round the now lifeless corpse, in <a id="id_2page35"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="35"></a>a piteous voice he implored his father's spirit to be appeased and not to turn against him as a parricide. The crime was his country's, he cried; what share had a single soldier in these civil wars? Meanwhile he lifted the body and began to dig a grave and perform the last rites for his father. Those who were nearest noticed this; then the story began to spread, till there ran through the army astonishment and many complaints and curses against this wicked war. Yet they never ceased busily killing and plundering friends and relatives and brothers; and while they talked of the crime they were committing it themselves.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap26"/><span class="chapnum">26</span>When they reached Cremona a fresh task of vast difficulty awaited them. During the war with <a id="id_2fnm75"/>Otho<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn75" class="2fnnum pginternal">75</a> the German army had entrenched their camp round the walls of Cremona and then erected a rampart round the camp; and these fortifications had been further strengthened. The sight of them brought the victors to a halt, and their generals were uncertain what instructions to give. The troops had had no rest for a day and a night. To storm the town at once would be an arduous and, in the absence of reserves, a perilous task. On the other hand, a retreat to Bedriacum would involve the intolerable fatigue of a long march, and destroy the value of their victory. Again, it would be dangerous to entrench themselves so close to the lines of the enemy, who might at any minute sally forth and rout them while they were dispersed and digging trenches. The chief anxiety lay in the temper <a id="id_2page36"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="36"></a>of the men, who were much more ready to face danger than delay. To them discretion was disagreeable and hazard spelt hope. Their thirst for plunder outweighed all fears of wounds and bloodshed.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap27"/><span class="chapnum">27</span>Antonius also inclined to this view and gave orders for them to surround the rampart. At first they stood back and delivered volleys of arrows and stones, suffering themselves the severer loss, for a storm of missiles rained down from the walls. Antonius then told off each legion to assault a different point of the rampart or one of the gates, hoping that by thus separating them he could distinguish the cowards from the brave and inflame them with a spirit of honourable rivalry. The Third and Seventh took the position nearest the road to Bedriacum; the Eighth and Seventh Claudian assaulted the right-hand side of the rampart; the Thirteenth swept up to the Brixian <a id="id_2fnm76"/>Gate.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn76" class="2fnnum pginternal">76</a> A brief delay was caused while some fetched mattocks and pickaxes from the fields, and others hooks and ladders. Then holding their shields above their heads in close 'tortoise' <a id="id_2fnm77"/>formation,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn77" class="2fnnum pginternal">77</a> they advanced under the rampart. Both sides employed Roman tactics. The Vitellians rolled down huge masses of stones, and, as the sheltering cover of shields parted and wavered, they thrust at it with lances and poles, until at last <a id="id_2page37"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="37"></a>the whole structure was broken up and they mowed down the torn and bleeding soldiers beneath with terrible slaughter.</p>
<p>The men would certainly have hesitated, had not the generals, realizing that they were really too tired to respond to any other form of encouragement, pointed significantly to Cremona. <a id="IIIchap28"/><span class="chapnum">28</span>Whether this was Hormus's idea, as <a id="id_2fnm78"/>Messala<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn78" class="2fnnum pginternal">78</a> records, or whether we should rather follow Caius Pliny, who accuses Antonius, it is not easy to determine. This one may say, that, however abominable the crime, yet in committing it neither Antonius nor Hormus belied the reputation of their lives. After this neither wounds nor bloodshed could stay the Flavian troops. They demolished the rampart, shook the gates, climbed up on each other's shoulders, or over the re-formed 'tortoise', and snatched away the enemy's weapons or caught hold of them by the arms. Thus the wounded and unwounded, the half-dead and the dying, all came rolling down and perished together by every imaginable kind of death.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap29"/><span class="chapnum">29</span>The fight raged thickest round the Third and Seventh legions, and the general, Antonius, came up with a picked band of auxiliaries to support their assault. The Vitellians, finding themselves unable to resist the attack of troops thus stubbornly vying with each other, and seeing their missiles all glide off the shelter of shields, at last sent their engine of war crashing down upon their heads. For the moment it <a id="id_2page38"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="38"></a>scattered and crushed beneath it the men on whom it fell, but it dragged with it some of the battlements and the top of the rampart. At the same moment one of the towers on the rampart gave way under a shower of stones. While the men of the Seventh struggled up to the breach in close column,<a id="id_2fnm79"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn79" class="2fnnum pginternal">79</a> the Third hewed down the gate with hatchets and swords. All the <a id="id_2fnm80"/>authorities<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn80" class="2fnnum pginternal">80</a> agree that Caius Volusius of the Third legion was the first man in. Emerging on the top of the rampart, he hurled down those who barred his path, and from this conspicuous position waved his hand and shouted that the camp was taken. The others poured through, while the Vitellians in panic flung themselves down from the rampart, and the whole space between the camp and the walls became a seething scene of carnage.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap30"/><span class="chapnum">30</span>Here, again, was a new type of task for the Flavians. Here were high walls, stone battlements, iron-barred gates, and soldiers hurling javelins. The citizens of Cremona were numerous and devoted to the cause of Vitellius, and half Italy had gathered there for the Fair which fell just at that time. Their numbers were a help to the defenders, but the prospect of plundering them offered an incentive to their assailants. Antonius ordered his men to bring fire and apply it to the most beautiful of the buildings outside the walls, hoping that the loss of their property might induce the citizens to turn traitor. The houses that stood nearest to <a id="id_2page39"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="39"></a>the walls and overtopped them he crowded with his bravest troops, who dislodged the defenders with showers of beams and tiles and flaming torches. <a id="IIIchap31"/><span class="chapnum">31</span>Meanwhile, some of the legionaries began to advance in 'tortoise' <a id="id_2fnm81"/>formation,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn81" class="2fnnum pginternal">81</a> while others kept up a steady fire of javelins and stones.</p>
<p>Gradually the spirit of the Vitellians ebbed. The higher their rank, the more easily they gave way to misfortune. For they were afraid that if Cremona <a id="id_2fnm82"/>too<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn82" class="2fnnum pginternal">82</a> was demolished, there would be no hope of pardon; the victors' fury would fall not on the common poor but on the tribunes and centurions, whom it would pay to kill. The common soldiers felt safe in their obscurity, and, careless of the future, continued to offer resistance. They roamed the streets or hid themselves in houses, and though they had given up the war, refused even so to sue for peace. Meanwhile the tribunes and centurions did away with the name and portraits of <a id="id_2fnm83"/>Vitellius.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn83" class="2fnnum pginternal">83</a> They released Caecina, who was still in <a id="id_2fnm84"/>irons,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn84" class="2fnnum pginternal">84</a> and begged his help in pleading their cause. When he turned from them in haughty contempt they besought him with tears. It was, indeed, the last of evils that all these brave men should invoke a traitor's aid. They then hung veils and <a id="id_2fnm85"/>fillets<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn85" class="2fnnum pginternal">85</a> out on the walls, and when Antonius had given the order to cease <a id="id_2page40"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="40"></a>firing, they carried out their standards and eagles, followed by a miserable column of disarmed soldiers, dejectedly hanging their heads. The victors had at first crowded round, heaping insults on them and threatening violence, but when they found that the vanquished had lost all their proud spirit, and turned their cheeks with servile endurance to every indignity, they gradually began to recollect that these were the men who had made such a moderate use of their victory at <a id="id_2fnm86"/>Bedriacum.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn86" class="2fnnum pginternal">86</a> But when the crowd parted, and Caecina advanced in his consular robes, attended by his lictors in full state, their indignation broke into flame. They charged him with insolence and cruelty, and—so hateful is crime—they even flung his treachery in his <a id="id_2fnm87"/>teeth.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn87" class="2fnnum pginternal">87</a> Antonius restrained them and sent Caecina under escort to Vespasian.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap32"/><span class="chapnum">32</span>Meanwhile the citizens of Cremona suffered sorely from the violence of the troops, and only the entreaties of their generals could withhold them from a general massacre. Antonius summoned a mass meeting and delivered a eulogy upon his victorious army, promising mercy to the vanquished and speaking of Cremona in ambiguous terms. Besides their natural passion for plunder, there was an old grudge which urged them to sack Cremona. The town was believed to have given assistance to the Vitellian cause before this in the war with Otho;<a id="id_2fnm88"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn88" class="2fnnum pginternal">88</a> and again, when the Thirteenth <a id="id_2page41"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="41"></a>had been left behind to build an <a id="id_2fnm89"/>amphitheatre,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn89" class="2fnnum pginternal">89</a> the populace had shown its town-bred impertinence by assailing them with insolent ridicule. Other causes increased this bad feeling: it was here that Caecina had given his show of gladiators:<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn89" class="2fnnum pginternal">89</a> the town had become for a second time the theatre of the war: the citizens had conveyed food to the Vitellians during the battle: some women had been killed, whose enthusiasm for the cause had led them to take part in the fight. Besides all this, the Fair had filled the rich city with an even greater display of wealth than usual. All eyes were now centred on Antonius, whose fame and good fortune overshadowed all the other generals. It so happened that he hurried off to the baths to wash off the stains of blood. Finding fault with the temperature of the water, he received the answer, 'It will not be long before it is hot,' and this phrase was caught up. The attendant's words were repeated, and brought all the odium on Antonius, who was thus believed to have given the signal to set fire to Cremona, which was already in <a id="id_2fnm90"/>flames.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn90" class="2fnnum pginternal">90</a></p>
<p><a id="IIIchap33"/><span class="chapnum">33</span>Thus forty thousand soldiers burst into the town with a yet larger crowd of servants and sutlers, even more depraved than the soldiers in their readiness for cruelty and lust. Without any respect for age or for <a id="id_2page42"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="42"></a>authority they added rape to murder and murder to rape. Aged men and decrepit old women, who were worthless as booty, were hustled off to make sport for them. If some grown girl or a handsome youth fell into their clutches, they would be torn to pieces in the struggle for possession, while the plunderers were left to cut each other's throats. Whoever carried off money or any of the solid gold offerings in the temples was liable to be cut to pieces, if he met another stronger than himself. Some, disdaining easy finds, hunted for hidden hoards, and dug out buried treasure, flogging and torturing the householders. They held torches in their hands and, having once secured their prize, would fling them wantonly into an empty house or some dismantled temple. Composed as the army was of citizens, allies, and foreign troops, differing widely in language and customs, the objects of the soldiers' greed differed also. But while their views of what was right might vary, they all agreed in thinking nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Cremona lasted them four days. While all other buildings sacred and secular sank in the flames, only the temple of Mefitis outside the walls was left standing, saved either by its position or the power of the presiding <a id="id_2fnm91"/>deity.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn91" class="2fnnum pginternal">91</a></p>
<p><a id="IIIchap34"/><span class="chapnum">34</span>Such was the end of Cremona two hundred and eighty-six years after its foundation. It had been originally built in the consulship of Tiberius Sempronius and Publius Cornelius, while Hannibal was <a id="id_2page43"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="43"></a>threatening to invade Italy, to serve as a bulwark against the Gauls beyond the <a id="id_2fnm92"/>Po,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn92" class="2fnnum pginternal">92</a> and to resist any other power that might break in over the Alps. And so it grew and flourished, aided by its large number of settlers, its conveniently situated rivers,<a id="id_2fnm93"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-11.htm.html#id_2fn93" class="2fnnum pginternal">93</a> the fertility of its territory, and its connexion through alliance and intermarriage with other communities. Foreign invasions had left it untouched only to become the victim of civil war. Antonius, ashamed of his crime, and realizing his growing disfavour, proclaimed that no citizen of Cremona was to be kept as a prisoner of war; and, indeed, the unanimous feeling in Italy against buying such slaves had already frustrated the soldiers' hope of profit. So they began to kill their captives, whose relatives and friends, when this became known, covertly bought their release. After a while, the rest of the inhabitants returned, and the squares and temples were rebuilt by the munificence of the burghers and under Vespasian's direct patronage.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap35"/><span class="chapnum">35</span>However, the soil was so foully infected by the reek of blood that it was impossible for the Flavians to encamp for long on the ruins of this buried city. They advanced along the road to the third milestone, and mustered the Vitellians, still straggling and panic-stricken, each under his own standard. The defeated legions were then distributed through Illyricum, for the civil war was still in progress and their fidelity <a id="id_2page44"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="44"></a>could not be relied on. They then dispatched couriers to carry the news to Britain and the Spanish provinces. To Gaul they sent an officer named Julius Calenus, to Germany Alpinius Montanus, who had commanded an auxiliary cohort. Montanus was a Treviran and Calenus an Aeduan; both had fought for Vitellius and thus served to advertise Vespasian's victory. At the same time garrisons were sent to hold the passes of the Alps, for fear that Germany might rise in support of Vitellius.</p>
