<h3 id="pgepubid00045"><a id="The_Taking"/>The Taking of Tarracina</h3>
<p><a id="IIIchap76"/><span class="chapnum">76</span>About this same time Lucius <a id="id_2fnm207"/>Vitellius,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn207" class="2fnnum pginternal">207</a> who had pitched his camp at the Temple of <a id="id_2fnm208"/>Feronia,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn208" class="2fnnum pginternal">208</a> made every effort to destroy Tarracina, where he had shut up the gladiators and sailors, who would not venture to leave the shelter of the walls or to face death in the open. The gladiators were commanded, as we have already seen,<a id="id_2fnm209"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn209" class="2fnnum pginternal">209</a> by Julianus, and the sailors by<a id="id_2page88"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="88"></a> Apollinaris, men whose dissolute inefficiency better suited gladiators than general officers. They set no watch, and made no attempt to repair the weak places in the walls. Day and night they idled loosely; the soldiers were dispatched in all directions to find them luxuries; that beautiful coast rang with their revelry; and they only spoke of war in their cups. A few days earlier, Apinius <a id="id_2fnm210"/>Tiro<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn210" class="2fnnum pginternal">210</a> had started on his mission, and, by rigorously requisitioning gifts of money in all the country towns, was winning more unpopularity than assistance for the cause.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap77"/><span class="chapnum">77</span>In the meantime, one of Vergilius Capito's slaves deserted to Lucius Vitellius, and promised that, if he were provided with men, he would put the abandoned castle into their hands. Accordingly, at dead of night he established a few lightly armed cohorts on the top of the hills which overlooked the enemy. Thence the soldiers came charging down more to butchery than battle. They cut down their victims standing helpless and unarmed or hunting for their weapons, or perhaps newly startled from their sleep—all in a bewildering confusion of darkness, panic, bugle-calls, and savage cries. A few of the gladiators resisted and sold their lives dearly. The rest rushed to the ships; and there the same panic and confusion reigned, for the villagers were all mixed up with the troops, and the Vitellians slaughtered them too, without distinction. Just as the <a id="id_2page89"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="89"></a>first uproar began, six Liburnian cruisers slipped away with the admiral Apollinaris on board. The rest were either captured on the beach or overweighted and sunk by the crowds that clambered over them. Julianus was taken to Lucius Vitellius, who had him flogged till he bled and then killed before his eyes. Some writers have accused Lucius Vitellius' wife, <a id="id_2fnm211"/>Triaria,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn211" class="2fnnum pginternal">211</a> of putting on a soldier's sword, and with insolent cruelty showing herself among the horrors of the captured town. Lucius himself sent a laurel-wreath to his brother in token of his success, and inquired whether he wished him to return at once or to continue reducing Campania. This delay saved not only Vespasian's party but Rome as well. Had he marched on the city while his men were fresh from their victory, with the flush of success added to their natural intrepidity, there would have been a tremendous struggle, which must have involved the city's destruction. Lucius Vitellius, too, for all his evil repute, was a man of action. Good men owe their power to their virtues; but he was one of that worst sort whose vices are their only virtue.</p>

Antonius has been suspected of delaying treacherously after receiving a secret communication from Vitellius, offering him as the price of treason the consulship, his young daughter, and a rich dowry. Others hold that this story was invented to gratify Mucianus. Many consider that the policy of all the Flavian generals was rather to threaten the city than to attack it. They realized that Vitellius had lost the best cohorts of his Guards, and now that all his forces were cut off they expected he would abdicate. But this prospect was spoilt first by Sabinus' precipitation and then by his cowardice, for, after very rashly taking arms, he failed to defend against three cohorts of Guards the strongly fortified castle on the Capitol, which ought to have been impregnable even to a large army. However, it is not easy to assign to any one man the blame which they all share. Even Mucianus helped to delay the victors' advance by the ambiguity of his dispatches, and Antonius was also to blame for his untimely compliance with instructions—or else for trying to throw the <a id="id_2fnm215"/>responsibility<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn215" class="2fnnum pginternal">215</a> on Mucianus. The other generals thought the war was over, and thus rendered its final scene all the more appalling. Petilius Cerialis was sent forward with a thousand cavalry to <a id="id_2page91"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="91"></a>make his way by cross-roads through the Sabine country, and enter the city by the Salarian <a id="id_2fnm216"/>road.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn216" class="2fnnum pginternal">216</a> But even he failed to make sufficient haste, and at last the news of the siege of the Capitol brought them all at once to their senses.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap79"/><span class="chapnum">79</span>Marching up the Flaminian road, it was already deep night when Antonius reached 'The Red Rocks'.<a id="id_2fnm217"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn217" class="2fnnum pginternal">217</a> His help had come too late. There he heard that Sabinus had been killed, and the Capitol burnt; the city was in panic; everything looked black; even the populace and the slaves were arming for Vitellius. Petilius Cerialis, too, had been defeated in a cavalry engagement. He had pushed on without caution, thinking the enemy already beaten, and the Vitellians with a mixed force of horse and foot had caught him unawares. The engagement had taken place near the city among farm buildings and gardens and winding lanes, with which the Vitellians were familiar, while the Flavians were terrified by their ignorance. Besides, the troopers were not all of one mind; some of them belonged to the force which had recently surrendered at Narnia, and were waiting to see which side won. Julius Flavianus, who commanded a regiment of cavalry, was taken prisoner. The rest fell into a disgraceful panic and fled, but the pursuit was not continued beyond Fidenae.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap80"/><span class="chapnum">80</span>This success served to increase the popular excitement. The city rabble now took arms. A few had service-shields: most of them snatched up any weapons <a id="id_2page92"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="92"></a>they could find and clamoured to be given the sign for battle. Vitellius expressed his gratitude to them and bade them sally forth to protect the city. He then summoned a meeting of the senate, at which envoys were appointed to go to the two armies and urge them in the name of public welfare to accept peace. The fortunes of the envoys varied. Those who approached Petilius Cerialis found themselves in dire danger, for the soldiers indignantly refused their terms. The praetor, Arulenus Rusticus,<a id="id_2fnm218"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn218" class="2fnnum pginternal">218</a> was wounded. Apart from the wrong done to a praetor and an envoy, the man's own acknowledged worth made this seem all the more scandalous. His companions were flogged, and the lictor nearest to him was killed for venturing to make a way through the crowd. Indeed, if the guard provided by the general had not intervened, a Roman envoy, the sanctity of whose person even foreign nations respect, might have been wickedly murdered in the mad rage of civil strife under the very walls of Rome. Those who went to Antonius met with a more reasonable reception; not that the soldiers were less violent, but the general had more authority.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap81"/><span class="chapnum">81</span>A knight named Musonius Rufus had attached himself to the envoys. He was a student of philosophy and an enthusiastic advocate of Stoicism. He mingled with the armed soldiers offering them advice and discoursing on the advantages of peace and the perils of war. This amused many of them and bored still <a id="id_2page93"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="93"></a>more. Some, indeed, wanted to maul him and kick him out, but the advice of the more sober spirits and the threats of others persuaded him to cut short his ill-timed lecture. The Vestal Virgins, too, came in procession to bring Antonius a letter from Vitellius, in which he demanded one day's postponement of the final crisis, saying that everything could easily be settled, if only they would grant this respite. Antonius sent the Virgins away with all respect, and wrote in answer to Vitellius that the murder of Sabinus and the burning of the Capitol had broken off all negotiations. <a id="IIIchap82"/><span class="chapnum">82</span>However, he summoned the legions to a meeting and endeavoured to mollify them, proposing that they should pitch their camp near the Mulvian Bridge and enter the city on the following day. His motive for delay was a fear that the troops, when once their blood was up after a skirmish, would have no respect for civilians or senators, or even for the temples and shrines of the gods. But they suspected every postponement as a hindrance to their victory. Moreover, some colours which were seen glittering along the hills, gave the impression of a hostile force, although none but peaceful citizens accompanied them.</p>
<p>The attack was made in three columns. One advanced from its original position on the Flaminian road, one kept near the bank of the Tiber, and the third approached the Colline Gate along the Salarian road. The cavalry rode into the mob and scattered them. But the Vitellian troops faced the enemy, themselves, too, in three separate divisions. Again <a id="id_2page94"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="94"></a>and again they engaged before the walls with varying success. But the Flavians had the advantage of being well led and thus more often won success. Only one of the attacking parties suffered at all severely, that which had made its way along narrow, greasy lanes to Sallust's <a id="id_2fnm219"/>Gardens<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn219" class="2fnnum pginternal">219</a> on the left side of the city. Standing on the garden walls, the Vitellians hurled stones and javelins down upon them and held them back until late in the day. But at last the cavalry forced an entrance by the Colline Gate and took the defenders in the rear. Then the opposing forces met on the Martian Plain itself. Fortune favoured the Flavians and the sense of victories won. The Vitellians charged in sheer despair, but, though driven back, they gathered again in the city.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap83"/><span class="chapnum">83</span>The people came and watched the fighting, cheering and applauding now one side, now the other, like spectators at a gladiatorial contest. Whenever one side gave ground, and the soldiers began to hide in shops or seek refuge in some private house, they clamoured for them to be dragged out and killed, and thus got the greater part of the plunder for themselves: for while the soldiers were busy with the bloody work of massacre, the spoil fell to the crowd. The scene throughout the city was hideous and terrible: on the one side fighting and wounded men, on the other baths and restaurants: here lay heaps of bleeding dead, and close at hand were harlots and their companions—all the vice and licence of luxurious peace, <a id="id_2page95"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="95"></a>and all the crime and horror of a captured town. One might well have thought the city mad with fury and mad with pleasure at the same time. Armies had fought in the city before this, twice when Sulla mastered <a id="id_2fnm220"/>Rome,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn220" class="2fnnum pginternal">220</a> once under <a id="id_2fnm221"/>Cinna.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn221" class="2fnnum pginternal">221</a> Nor were there less horrors then. What was now so inhuman was the people's indifference. Not for one minute did they interrupt the life of pleasure. The fighting was a new amusement for their holiday.<a id="id_2fnm222"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn222" class="2fnnum pginternal">222</a> Caring nothing for either party, they enjoyed themselves in riotous dissipation and took a frank pleasure in their country's disaster.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap84"/><span class="chapnum">84</span>The storming of the Guards' camp was the most troublesome task. It was still held by some of the bravest as a forlorn hope, which made the victors all the more eager to take it, especially those who had originally served in the Guards. They employed against it every means ever devised for the storming of the most strongly fortified towns, a 'tortoise',<a id="id_2fnm223"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn223" class="2fnnum pginternal">223</a> artillery, earthworks, firebrands. This, they cried, was the crown of all the toil and danger they had undergone in all their battles. They had restored the city to the senate and people of Rome, and their Temples to the gods: the soldier's pride is his camp, it is his country and his home. If they could not regain it at once, they must spend the night in fighting. The Vitellians, for their part, had numbers and fortune against them, but by marring their enemy's victory, by postponing <a id="id_2page96"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="96"></a>peace, by fouling houses and altars with their blood, they embraced the last consolations that the conquered can enjoy. Many lay more dead than alive on the towers and ramparts of the walls and there expired. When the gates were torn down, the remainder faced the conquerors in a body. And there they fell, every man of them facing the enemy with all his wounds in front. Even as they died they took care to make an honourable end.</p>
<p>When the city was taken, Vitellius left the Palace by a back way and was carried in a litter to his wife's house on the Aventine. If he could lie hid during the day, he hoped to make his escape to his brother and the Guards at Tarracina. But it is in the very nature of terror that, while any course looks dangerous, the present state of things seems worst of all. His fickle determination soon changed and he returned to the vast, deserted Palace, whence even the lowest of his menials had fled, or at least avoided meeting him. Shuddering at the solitude and hushed silence of the place, he wandered about, trying closed doors, terrified to find the rooms empty; until at last, wearied with his miserable search, he crept into some shameful hiding-place. There Julius Placidus, an officer of the Guards, found him and dragged him out. His hands were tied behind his back, his clothes were torn, and thus he was led forth—a loathly spectacle at which many hurled insults and no one shed a single tear of pity. The ignominy of his end killed all compassion. On the way a soldier of the German army either <a id="id_2page97"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="97"></a>aimed an angry blow at him, or tried to put him out of his shame, or meant, perhaps, to strike the officer in command; at any rate, he cut off the officer's ear and was immediately stabbed. <a id="IIIchap85"/><span class="chapnum">85</span>With the points of their swords they made Vitellius hold up his head and face their insults, forcing him again and again to watch his own statues hurtling down, or to look at the Rostra and the spot where Galba had been killed. At last he was dragged along to the Ladder of <a id="id_2fnm224"/>Sighs,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn224" class="2fnnum pginternal">224</a> where the body of Flavius Sabinus had lain. One saying of his which was recorded had a ring of true nobility. When some officer flung reproaches at him, he answered, 'And yet I was once your emperor.' After that he fell under a shower of wounds, and when he was dead the mob abused him as loudly as they had flattered him in his lifetime—and with as little reason.</p>
<p><a id="IIIchap86"/><span class="chapnum">86</span>Vitellius' home was at <a id="id_2fnm225"/>Luceria.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn225" class="2fnnum pginternal">225</a> He was in his fifty-seventh year, and had won the consulship, priesthoods, and a name and position among Rome's greatest men, all of which he owed to no efforts of his own, but solely to his father's <a id="id_2fnm226"/>eminence.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn226" class="2fnnum pginternal">226</a> Those who offered him the throne had not yet learnt to know him; and yet his slothful cowardice won from his soldiers an enthusiasm which the best of generals have rarely evoked. Still he had the qualities of candour and generosity, which without moderation are <a id="id_2page98"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="98"></a>liable to prove disastrous. He had few friends, though he bought many, thinking to keep them, not by showing moral stamina, but by giving liberal presents. It was indubitably good for the country that Vitellius should be beaten. But those who betrayed him to Vespasian can hardly make a merit of their perfidy, for they were the very men who had deserted Galba for Vitellius.</p>
<p>The day was already sinking into evening. The magistrates and senators had fled in terror from the city, or were still in hiding at dependants' houses: it was therefore impossible to call a meeting of the senate. When all fear of violence was at an end, Domitian came <a id="id_2fnm227"/>out<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-13.htm.html#id_2fn227" class="2fnnum pginternal">227</a> and presented himself to the generals of his party. The crowds of soldiers at once hailed him as Caesar, and marched off, still in full armour, to escort him to his father's house.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00048"><a id="Rome_after"/>Rome after the Fall of Vitellius</h3>
<p class="center">(January-July, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 70)</p>
<p class="gaplet"><a id="IVchap1"/><span class="chapnum">1</span>The death of Vitellius ended the war without inaugurating peace. The victors remained under arms, and the defeated Vitellians were hunted through the city with implacable hatred, and butchered promiscuously wherever they were found. The streets were choked with corpses; squares and temples ran with blood. Soon the riot knew no restraint; they began to hunt for those who were in hiding and to drag them out. All who were tall and of youthful appearance, whether soldiers or civilians, were cut down <a id="id_2fnm228"/>indiscriminately.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn228" class="2fnnum pginternal">228</a> While their rage was fresh they sated their savage cravings with blood; then suddenly the instinct of greed prevailed. On the pretext of hunting for hidden enemies, they would leave no door unopened and regard no privacy. Thus they began to rifle private houses or else made resistance an excuse for murder. There were plenty of needy citizens, too, and of rascally slaves, who were perfectly ready to betray wealthy householders: others were indicated by their friends. From all sides came cries of mourning <a id="id_2page100"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="100"></a>and misery. Rome was like a captured city. People even longed to have the insolent soldiery of Otho and Vitellius back again, much as they had been hated. The Flavian generals, who had fanned the flame of civil war with such energy, were incapable of using their victory temperately. In riot and disorder the worst characters take the lead; peace and quiet call for the highest qualities.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap2"/><span class="chapnum">2</span>Domitian having secured the title and the official residence of a <a id="id_2fnm229"/>Caesar,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn229" class="2fnnum pginternal">229</a> did not as yet busy himself with serious matters, but in his character of emperor's son devoted himself to dissolute intrigues. Arrius <a id="id_2fnm230"/>Varus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn230" class="2fnnum pginternal">230</a> took command of the Guards, but the supreme authority rested with Antonius Primus. He removed money and slaves from the emperor's house as though he were plundering Cremona. The other generals, from excess of modesty or lack of spirit, shared neither the distinctions of the war nor the profits of peace.</p>
<p>People in Rome were now so nervous and so resigned to despotism that they demanded that Lucius Vitellius and his force of Guards should be surprised on their way back from <a id="id_2fnm231"/>Tarracina,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn231" class="2fnnum pginternal">231</a> and the last sparks of the war stamped out. Some cavalry were sent forward to Aricia, while the column of the legions halted short of Bovillae.<a id="id_2fnm232"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn232" class="2fnnum pginternal">232</a> Vitellius, however, lost no time in surrendering himself and his Guards to the conqueror's <a id="id_2page101"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="101"></a>discretion, and the men flung away their unlucky swords more in anger than in fear. The long line of prisoners filed through the city between ranks of armed guards. None looked like begging for mercy. With sad, set faces they remained sternly indifferent to the applause or the mockery of the ribald crowd. A few tried to break away, but were surrounded and overpowered. The rest were put in prison. Not one of them gave vent to any unseemly complaint. Through all their misfortunes they preserved their reputation for courage. Lucius Vitellius was then executed. He was as weak as his brother, though during the principate he showed himself less indolent. Without sharing his brother's success, he was carried away on the flood of his disaster.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap3"/><span class="chapnum">3</span>At this time Lucilius <a id="id_2fnm233"/>Bassus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn233" class="2fnnum pginternal">233</a> was sent off with a force of light horse to quell the disquiet in Campania, which was caused more by the mutual jealousy of the townships than by any opposition to the emperor. The sight of the soldiers restored order. The smaller colonies were pardoned, but at Capua the Third <a id="id_2fnm234"/>legion<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn234" class="2fnnum pginternal">234</a> was left in winter quarters and some of the leading families fined.<a id="id_2fnm235"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn235" class="2fnnum pginternal">235</a> Tarracina, on the other hand, received no relief. It is always easier to requite an injury than a service: gratitude is a burden, but revenge is found to pay. Their only consolation was that one of Vergilius Capito's slaves, who had, as we <a id="id_2page102"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="102"></a>have <a id="id_2fnm236"/>seen,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn236" class="2fnnum pginternal">236</a> betrayed the town, was hanged on the gallows with the very <a id="id_2fnm237"/>rings<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn237" class="2fnnum pginternal">237</a> on his fingers which Vitellius had given him to wear.</p>
<p>At Rome the senate decreed to Vespasian all the usual prerogatives of the <a id="id_2fnm238"/>principate.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn238" class="2fnnum pginternal">238</a> They were now happy and confident. Seeing that the civil war had broken out in the provinces of Gaul and Spain, and after causing a rebellion first in Germany and then in Illyricum, had spread to Egypt, Judaea, <a id="id_2fnm239"/>Syria,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn239" class="2fnnum pginternal">239</a> and in fact to all the provinces and armies of the empire, they felt that the world had been purged as by fire and that all was now over. Their satisfaction was still further enhanced by a letter from Vespasian, which at first sight seemed to be phrased as if the war was still going on. Still his tone was that of an emperor, though he spoke of himself as a simple citizen and gave his country all the glory. The senate for its part showed no lack of deference. They decreed that Vespasian himself should be consul with Titus for his colleague, and on Domitian they conferred the praetorship with the powers of a consul.<a id="id_2fnm240"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn240" class="2fnnum pginternal">240</a></p>
<p><a id="IVchap4"/><span class="chapnum">4</span>Mucianus had also addressed a letter to the senate <a id="id_2page103"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="103"></a>which gave rise to a good deal of <a id="id_2fnm241"/>talk.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn241" class="2fnnum pginternal">241</a> If he were a private citizen, why adopt the official tone? He could have expressed the same opinions a few days later from his place in the House. Besides, his attack on Vitellius came too late to prove his independence, and what seemed particularly humiliating for the country and insulting to the emperor was his boast that he had held the empire in the hollow of his hand, and had given it to Vespasian. However, they concealed their ill-will and made a great show of flattery, decreeing to Mucianus in the most complimentary terms full triumphal honours, which were really given him for his success against his fellow countrymen, though they trumped up an expedition to Sarmatia as a <a id="id_2fnm242"/>pretext.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn242" class="2fnnum pginternal">242</a> On Antonius Primus they conferred the insignia of the consulship, and those of the praetorship on Cornelius Fuscus and Arrius Varus. Then came the turn of the gods: it was decided to restore the Capitol. These proposals were all moved by the consul-designate, Valerius <a id="id_2fnm243"/>Asiaticus.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn243" class="2fnnum pginternal">243</a> The others signified assent by smiling and holding up their hands, though a few, who were particularly distinguished, or especially practised in the art of flattery, delivered set speeches. When it came to the turn of Helvidius Priscus, the praetor-designate, he expressed himself in terms which, while doing honour to a good emperor, were perfectly frank <a id="id_2page104"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="104"></a>and <a id="id_2fnm244"/>honest.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn244" class="2fnnum pginternal">244</a> The senate showed their keen approval, and it was this day which first won for him great disfavour and great distinction.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap5"/><span class="chapnum">5</span>Since I have had occasion to make a second <a id="id_2fnm245"/>allusion<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn245" class="2fnnum pginternal">245</a> to a man whom I shall often have to mention <a id="id_2fnm246"/>again,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn246" class="2fnnum pginternal">246</a> it may be well to give here a brief account of his character and ideals, and of his fortune in life. Helvidius Priscus came from the country town of Cluviae.<a id="id_2fnm247"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn247" class="2fnnum pginternal">247</a> His father had been a senior centurion in the army. From his early youth Helvidius devoted his great intellectual powers to the higher studies, not as many people do, with the idea of using a philosopher's reputation as a cloak for <a id="id_2fnm248"/>indolence,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn248" class="2fnnum pginternal">248</a> but rather to fortify himself against the caprice of fortune when he entered public life. He became a follower of that school of <a id="id_2fnm249"/>philosophy<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn249" class="2fnnum pginternal">249</a> which holds that honesty is the one good thing in life and sin the only evil, while power and rank and other such external things, not being qualities of character, are neither good nor bad. He had risen no higher than the rank of quaestor when Paetus Thrasea chose him for his son-in-law,<a id="id_2fnm250"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn250" class="2fnnum pginternal">250</a> and of Thrasea's virtues he absorbed none so much as his independence. As citizen, senator, husband, son-in-law, friend, in every sphere of life he was thoroughly consistent, always showing contempt <a id="id_2page105"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="105"></a>for money, stubborn persistence in the right, and courage in the face of danger. <a id="IVchap6"/><span class="chapnum">6</span>Some people thought him too ambitious, for even with philosophers the passion for fame is often their last rag of infirmity. After Thrasea's fall Helvidius was banished, but he returned to Rome under Galba and proceeded to prosecute Eprius <a id="id_2fnm251"/>Marcellus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn251" class="2fnnum pginternal">251</a> who had informed against his father-in-law. This attempt to secure a revenge, as bold as it was just, divided the senate into two parties, for the fall of Marcellus would involve the ruin of a whole army of similar offenders. At first the struggle was full of recrimination, as the famous speeches on either side testify; but after a while, finding that Galba's attitude was doubtful and that many of the senators begged him to desist, Helvidius dropped the prosecution. On his action in this matter men's comments varied with their character, some praising his moderation, others asking what had become of his tenacity.</p>
<p>To return to the senate: at the same meeting at which they voted powers to Vespasian they also decided to send a deputation to address him. This gave rise to a sharp dispute between Helvidius Priscus and Eprius Marcellus. The former thought the members of the deputation ought to be nominated by magistrates acting under oath; Marcellus demanded their selection by lot. The consul-designate had already spoken in <a id="IVchap7"/><span class="chapnum">7</span>favour of the latter method, but Marcellus' motive was personal vanity, for he was afraid that if others <a id="id_2page106"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="106"></a>were chosen he would seem slighted. Their exchange of views gradually grew into a formal and acrimonious debate. Helvidius inquired why it was that Marcellus was so afraid of the magistrates' judgement, seeing that he himself had great advantages of wealth and of eloquence over many others. Could it be the memory of his misdeeds that so oppressed him? The fall of the lot could not discern character: but the whole point of submitting people to the vote and to scrutiny by the senate was to get at the truth about each man's life and reputation. In the interest of the country, and out of respect to Vespasian, it was important that he should be met by men whom the senate considered beyond reproach, men who would give the emperor a taste for honest language. Vespasian had been a friend of Thrasea, Soranus, and <a id="id_2fnm252"/>Sentius,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn252" class="2fnnum pginternal">252</a> and even though there might be no need to punish their prosecutors, still it would be wrong to put them forward. Moreover, the senate's selection would be a sort of hint to the emperor whom to approve and whom to avoid. 'Good friends are the most effective instruments of good government. Marcellus ought to be content with having driven Nero to destroy so many innocent people. Let him enjoy the impunity and the profit he has won from that, and leave Vespasian to more honest advisers.'</p>
<p><a id="id_2page107"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="107"></a><a id="IVchap8"/><span class="chapnum">8</span>Marcellus replied that the opinion which was being impugned was not his own. The consul-designate had already advised them to follow the established precedent, which was that deputations should be chosen by lot, so that there should be no room for intrigue or personal animosity. Nothing had happened to justify them in setting aside such an ancient system. Why turn a compliment to the emperor into a slight upon some one else? Anybody could do homage. What they had to avoid was the possibility that some people's obstinacy might irritate the emperor at the outset of his reign, while his intentions were undecided and he was still busy watching faces and listening to what was said. 'I have not forgotten,' he went on, 'the days of my youth or the constitution which our fathers and grandfathers <a id="id_2fnm253"/>established.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn253" class="2fnnum pginternal">253</a> But while admiring a distant past, I support the existing state of things. I pray for good emperors, but I take them as they come. As for Thrasea, it was not my speech but the senate's verdict which did for him. Nero took a savage delight in farces like that trial, and, really, the friendship of such an emperor cost me as much anxiety as banishment did to others. In fine, Helvidius may be as brave and as firm as any Brutus or Cato; I am but a senator and we are all slaves together. Besides, I advise my friend not to try and get an upper hand with our emperor or to force his tuition on a man of ripe <a id="id_2fnm254"/>years,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn254" class="2fnnum pginternal">254</a> who wears the insignia of a triumph and is the father <a id="id_2page108"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="108"></a>of two grown sons. Bad rulers like absolute sovereignty, and even the best of them must set some limit to their subjects' independence.'</p>
<p>This heated interchange of arguments found supporters for both views. The party which wanted the deputies chosen by lot eventually prevailed, since even the moderates were anxious to observe the precedent, and all the most prominent members tended to vote with them, for fear of encountering ill-feeling if they were selected.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap9"/><span class="chapnum">9</span>This dispute was followed by another. The Praetors, who in those days administered the <a id="id_2fnm255"/>Treasury,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn255" class="2fnnum pginternal">255</a> complained of the spread of poverty in the country and demanded some restriction of expenditure. The consul-designate said that, as the undertaking would be so vast and the remedy so difficult, he was in favour of leaving it for the emperor. Helvidius maintained that it ought to be settled by the senate's decision. When the consuls began to take each senator's opinion, Vulcacius Tertullinus, one of the tribunes, interposed his veto, on the ground that they could not decide such an important question in the emperor's absence. Helvidius had previously moved that the Capitol should be restored at the public cost, and with the assistance of Vespasian. The moderates all passed over this suggestion in silence and soon <a id="id_2page109"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="109"></a>forgot it, but there were others who took care to remember <a id="id_2fnm256"/>it.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn256" class="2fnnum pginternal">256</a></p>
<p><a id="IVchap10"/><span class="chapnum">10</span>It was at this time that Musonius <a id="id_2fnm257"/>Rufus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn257" class="2fnnum pginternal">257</a> brought an action against Publius Celer on the ground that it was only by perjury that he had secured the conviction of Soranus <a id="id_2fnm258"/>Barea.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn258" class="2fnnum pginternal">258</a> It was felt that this trial restarted the hue and cry against professional accusers. But the defendant was a rascal of no importance who could not be sheltered, and, moreover, Barea's memory was sacred. Celer had set up as a teacher of philosophy and then committed perjury against his pupil Barea, thus treacherously violating the very principles of friendship which he professed to teach. The case was put down for the next day's <a id="id_2fnm259"/>meeting.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn259" class="2fnnum pginternal">259</a> But now that a taste for revenge was aroused, people were all agog to see not so much Musonius and Publius as Priscus and Marcellus and the rest in court.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap11"/><span class="chapnum">11</span>Thus the senate quarrelled; the defeated party nursed their grievances; the winners had no power to enforce their will; law was in abeyance and the emperor absent. This state of things continued until Mucianus arrived in Rome and took everything into his own hands. This shattered the supremacy of Antonius and Varus, for, though Mucianus tried to show a friendly face towards them, he was not very <a id="id_2page110"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="110"></a>successful in concealing his dislike. But the people of Rome, having acquired great skill in detecting strained relations, had already transferred their allegiance. Mucianus was now the sole object of their flattering attentions. And he lived up to them. He surrounded himself with an armed escort, and kept changing his house and gardens. His display, his public appearances, the night-watch that guarded him, all showed that he had adopted the style of an emperor while forgoing the title. The greatest alarm was aroused by his execution of Calpurnius Galerianus, a son of Caius <a id="id_2fnm260"/>Piso.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn260" class="2fnnum pginternal">260</a> He had attempted no treachery, but his distinguished name and handsome presence had made the youth a subject of common talk, and the country was full of turbulent spirits who delighted in revolutionary rumours and idly talked of his coming to the throne. Mucianus gave orders that he should be arrested by a body of soldiers, and to avoid a conspicuous execution in the heart of the city, they marched him forty miles along the Appian road, where they severed his veins and let him bleed to death. Julius Priscus, who had commanded the Guards under Vitellius, committed suicide, more from shame than of necessity. Alfenus Varus survived the disgrace of his cowardice.<a id="id_2fnm261"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn261" class="2fnnum pginternal">261</a> <a id="id_2fnm262"/>Asiaticus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn262" class="2fnnum pginternal">262</a> who was a freedman, paid for his malign influence by dying the death of a <a id="id_2fnm263"/>slave.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn263" class="2fnnum pginternal">263</a></p>
