<h3 id="pgepubid00025"><a id="Vespasian_and_the_East"/>Vespasian and the East</h3>
<p><a id="IIchap1"/><span class="chapnum">1</span>Meanwhile, on the other side of Europe, Fortune was already sowing the seeds of a dynasty, the varying fortunes of which were destined to bring at one time happiness to the country and success to its rulers, at another misery to the country and to the rulers destruction.<a id="id_1fnm201"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn201" class="fnnum pginternal">201</a> Before Galba's fall Titus Vespasianus had been dispatched by his father from Judaea to <a id="id_1fnm202"/>Rome.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn202" class="fnnum pginternal">202</a> The ostensible reason of his journey was to show respect to the new emperor, and to solicit some post for which his years now fitted <a id="id_1fnm203"/>him.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn203" class="fnnum pginternal">203</a> However, the popular passion for invention suggested that he had been summoned to be adopted. This rumour was based on the fact that Galba was old and childless: the public never wearies of appointing successors until the choice is made. The character of Titus gave still more colour to it. He seemed capable of filling any position. His appearance lacked neither charm nor dignity. Vespasian's successes also and the utterances of certain oracles further endorsed the rumour, to say nothing of the chance occurrences which pass for omens where the wish is father to the thought. It <a id="id_1page111"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="111"></a>was at Corinth in Achaia that Titus received the news of Galba's murder, and was assured by people in the town that Vitellius had declared war. In great perplexity he summoned a few of his friends and discussed all the possibilities of the situation. If he continued his journey to Rome he would earn no gratitude for compliments addressed to another <a id="id_1fnm204"/>sovereign,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn204" class="fnnum pginternal">204</a> and would be held as a hostage either for Vitellius or for Otho: on the other hand, if he returned to Judaea he would inevitably offend the victor. However, the struggle was still undecided, and the father's adherence to the successful party would excuse the conduct of the son. Or if Vespasian himself assumed sovereignty, they would have to plan war and forget all about giving offence.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap2"/><span class="chapnum">2</span>Such considerations held him balanced between hope and fear; but ultimately hope prevailed. Some people believed that his longing to get back to Queen <a id="id_1fnm205"/>Berenice<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn205" class="fnnum pginternal">205</a> fired him to return. True, the young man's fancy was attracted by Berenice, but he did not allow this to interfere with business. Still his youth was a time of gay self-indulgence, and he showed more restraint in his own reign than in his father's. Accordingly he sailed along the coasts of Greece and Asia Minor, <a id="id_1page112"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="112"></a>and, skirting the seas which lay upon his left, reached the islands of Rhodes and Cyprus, whence he made a bolder crossing to <a id="id_1fnm206"/>Syria.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn206" class="fnnum pginternal">206</a> On his way he conceived a desire to visit the temple of Venus at <a id="id_1fnm207"/>Paphos,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn207" class="fnnum pginternal">207</a> which is famous among all the inhabitants and visitors. It may not be tedious to give here a short account of the origin of this worship, the ritual of the cult, and the shape—unparalleled elsewhere—in which the goddess is depicted.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap3"/><span class="chapnum">3</span>According to an old tradition the temple was founded by King Aerias, and some people maintain that the goddess bears the same name. A more modern version states that the temple was consecrated by <a id="id_1fnm208"/>Cinyras,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn208" class="fnnum pginternal">208</a> on the spot where the goddess landed when the sea gave her birth. The method of <a id="id_1fnm209"/>divination,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn209" class="fnnum pginternal">209</a> however, according to this account, was imported from elsewhere by the Cilician Tamiras, and an arrangement was made that the descendants of both families should preside over the rites. Later, however, it seemed wrong that the royal line should have no prerogative, so the descendants of the <a id="id_1fnm210"/>foreigner<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn210" class="fnnum pginternal">210</a> resigned the practice of the art which they had themselves introduced, and now the priest whom you consult is always of the line of Cinyras. They accept any victim that is offered, but males are preferred. They put most faith <a id="id_1page113"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="113"></a>in kids' entrails. Blood must not be poured on the altar, at which they offer only prayers and fire untainted by smoke. Although the altars stand in the open air they are never wetted by rain. The goddess is not represented in human form; the idol is a sort of circular <a id="id_1fnm211"/>pyramid,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn211" class="fnnum pginternal">211</a> rising from a broad base to a small round top, like a turning-post. The reason of this is unknown.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap4"/><span class="chapnum">4</span>Titus inspected the temple treasures and the offerings made by various kings, and other curiosities which the Greek passion for archaeology attributes to a dim antiquity. He then consulted the oracle first about his voyage. Learning that the sea was calm, and that no obstacles stood in his way, he sacrificed a large number of victims, and put covert questions about his own fortunes. The priest, whose name was Sostratus, seeing that the entrails were uniformly favourable, and that the goddess assented to Titus' ambitious schemes, returned at the moment a brief and ordinary reply, but afterwards sought a private interview and revealed the future to him. So Titus returned to his father with heightened hopes, and amid the general anxiety of the provinces and their armies his arrival spread boundless confidence of success.</p>
<p>Vespasian had already broken the back of the Jewish <a id="id_1fnm212"/>war.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn212" class="fnnum pginternal">212</a> Only the siege of Jerusalem remained. That this proved a difficult and laborious task was due rather to the high situation of the town and the <a id="id_1page114"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="114"></a>stubborn superstition of its inhabitants than to any adequate provision enabling them to endure the hardships of the siege. Vespasian had, as we have already <a id="id_1fnm213"/>stated,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn213" class="fnnum pginternal">213</a> three legions well tried in war. Four others were under Mucianus' command.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn213" class="fnnum pginternal">213</a> Although these had never seen war, yet their envy of the neighbouring army's fame had banished sloth. Indeed, as the former were hardened by work and danger, so the latter owed their ardour to their unbroken inaction, and their shame at having no share in the war.<a id="id_1fnm214"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn214" class="fnnum pginternal">214</a> Both generals had, besides auxiliary infantry and cavalry, foreign <a id="id_1fnm215"/>fleets<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn215" class="fnnum pginternal">215</a> and allied <a id="id_1fnm216"/>princes,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn216" class="fnnum pginternal">216</a> and a fame that rested on widely differing claims. <a id="IIchap5"/><span class="chapnum">5</span>Vespasian was an indefatigable campaigner. He headed the column, chose the camping-ground, never ceasing by night or day to use strategy, and, if need be, the sword to thwart the enemy. He eat what he could get, and dressed almost like a common soldier. Indeed, save for his avarice, he matched the generals of old days. Mucianus, on the other hand, was distinguished by his wealth and luxury, and his general superiority to the standards of a private person. He was the better speaker, and a skilful administrator and statesman. Their combined qualities would have made a fine <a id="id_1page115"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="115"></a>emperor, if one could have blended their virtues and omitted their vices. Governing as they did the neighbouring provinces of Judaea and Syria, jealousy at first led to quarrels. However, on the death of Nero, they forgot their dislike and joined hands. It was their friends who first brought them together, and subsequently Titus became the chief bond of union and for the common good suppressed their ignoble jealousy. Both by nature and training he had charm to fascinate even such a man as Mucianus. The tribunes and centurions and the common soldiers were attracted, each according to his character, either by Titus' meritorious industry or by his gay indulgence in pleasure.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap6"/><span class="chapnum">6</span>Before the arrival of Titus both armies had sworn allegiance to Otho. News travels fast in such cases, but civil war is a slow and serious undertaking, and the East, after its long repose, was now for the first time beginning to arm for it. In earlier times all the fiercest civil wars broke out in Italy or Cisalpine Gaul among the forces of the West. Pompey, Cassius, Brutus, and Antony all courted disaster by carrying the war oversea. Syria and Judaea often heard of Caesars, but seldom saw one. There were no mutinies among the soldiers. They merely made demonstrations against Parthia with varying success. Even in the last civil <a id="id_1fnm217"/>war<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn217" class="fnnum pginternal">217</a> the peace of these provinces had been untroubled by the general confusion. Later they were loyal to Galba. But when they heard that Otho and Vitellius were engaged in a wicked contest for the possession <a id="id_1page116"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="116"></a>of the Roman world, the troops began to chafe at the thought that the prizes of empire should fall to others, while their own lot was mere compulsory submission. They began to take stock of their strength. Syria and Judaea had seven legions on the spot with a vast force of auxiliaries. Next came Egypt with two legions:<a id="id_1fnm218"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn218" class="fnnum pginternal">218</a> beyond lay Cappadocia and Pontus, and all the forts along the Armenian frontier. Asia and the remaining provinces were rich and thickly populated. As for the islands, their girdle of sea was safe from the enemy and aided the prosecution of the war.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap7"/><span class="chapnum">7</span>The generals were well aware of the soldiers' feelings, but decided to await the issue between Vitellius and Otho. 'In civil war,' they reckoned, 'there are no sure ties to unite victor and vanquished. It matters little which survives: even good generals are corrupted by success: as for Otho and Vitellius, their troops are quarrelsome, lazy, and luxurious, and they are both the victims of their own vices. One will fall on the field and the other succumb to his success.' So Vespasian and Mucianus postponed their attack for the present. They were themselves recent converts to the project of war, which the <a id="id_1fnm219"/>others<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn219" class="fnnum pginternal">219</a> had long fostered from various motives. The better sort were animated by patriotism, many by mere love of plunder, some by the uncertainty of their own fortunes. Thus, though their motives differed, all, good and bad alike, agreed in their eager desire for war.</p>
<p><a id="id_1page117"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="117"></a></p>
<p><a id="IIchap8"/><span class="chapnum">8</span></p>
<p>About this time Achaia and Asia were thrown into 8 a groundless panic by a rumour that 'Nero was at hand'. The accounts of his death being many and various, people were all the more inclined to allege and to believe that he was still alive. We shall mention in the course of this work the attempts and the fate of the other pretenders.<a id="id_1fnm220"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn220" class="fnnum pginternal">220</a> This time it was a slave from Pontus, or, according to other traditions, a freedman from Italy. His skill as a singer and harpist, combined with his facial resemblance to Nero, gave him some credentials for imposture. He bribed some penniless and vagabond deserters by dazzling promises to join him, and they all set out to sea. A storm drove them on to the island of <a id="id_1fnm221"/>Cythnus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn221" class="fnnum pginternal">221</a> where he found some troops homeward bound on leave from the East. Some of these he enrolled, killing all who resisted, and then proceeded to plunder the local merchants and arm all the sturdiest of the slaves. Finding a centurion named Sisenna carrying home a pair of silver <a id="id_1fnm222"/>hands<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn222" class="fnnum pginternal">222</a> as a token of alliance from the army in Syria to the Household Guards, he tried by various devices to seduce him, until Sisenna took fright and escaped secretly from the island in fear of violence. Thus the panic spread. The great name of Nero attracted many who pined for revolution and hated the existing state of things. The rumours <a id="id_1page118"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="118"></a>waxed daily, until a chance dispelled them. <a id="IIchap9"/><span class="chapnum">9</span>Galba had entrusted the government of Galatia and <a id="id_1fnm223"/>Pamphylia<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn223" class="fnnum pginternal">223</a> to Calpurnius Asprenas, who had been granted an escort of two triremes from the fleet at Misenum. It so happened that with these he touched at Cythnus. The rebels lost no time in appealing to the ship's captains in the name of Nero. The pretender, assuming an air of melancholy, appealed to 'the loyalty of his former soldiers', and begged them to establish him in Syria or Egypt. The captains either from sympathy or guile alleged that they must talk to their men, and would come back when they had prepared all their minds. However, they faithfully made a full report to Asprenas, on whose instructions they boarded the ship and killed the impostor, whoever he was. The man's eyes and hair and ferocious look were so remarkable that the body was carried into Asia and thence to Rome.</p>

<p><a id="IIchap10"/><span class="chapnum">10</span>In a country so divided and tossed by frequent change of rulers between liberty and licence even small events caused serious disturbance. It happened that Vibius <a id="id_1fnm224"/>Crispus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn224" class="fnnum pginternal">224</a> a man whose wealth, influence, and ability had won him a reputation that was great rather than good, had impeached before the senate a man of equestrian rank, called Annius Faustus, who <a id="id_1page119"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="119"></a>had been a professional informer under Nero. The senate had recently in Galba's principate passed a resolution authorizing the prosecution of informers. This resolution had been variously applied from time to time, and interpreted rigorously or leniently according as the defendant was helpless or influential. But it still retained some terrors. Crispus, moreover, had exerted all his powers to secure the conviction of the man who had informed against his <a id="id_1fnm225"/>brother.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn225" class="fnnum pginternal">225</a> He had, in fact, induced a large proportion of the senate to demand that Faustus should be sent to execution undefended and unheard. However, with others, the defendant gained a great advantage from his prosecutor's undue influence. 'We must give him time,' they argued, 'the charges must be published: however hateful the criminal his case must be properly heard.' At first this advice prevailed. The trial was postponed for a few days. At length came the conviction of Faustus, which aroused in the country less satisfaction than his vile character warranted. People recalled the fact that Crispus himself had turned informer with pecuniary profit. It was not the penalty but the prosecutor that was unpopular.</p>

<p><a id="IIchap11"/><span class="chapnum">11</span>Meanwhile the war opened successfully for Otho. At his order the armies of Dalmatia and Pannonia started from their base.

But the stronger their numbers the greater their self-confidence and the slower their march. The cavalry and auxiliaries preceded the main body of the legions. From Rome itself came no mean force, five regiments of Guards with some detachments of cavalry and the First <a id="id_1fnm230"/>legion.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn230" class="fnnum pginternal">230</a> To these were added an irregular force of 2,000 <a id="id_1fnm231"/>gladiators,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn231" class="fnnum pginternal">231</a> a shameful assistance of which during the civil wars even strict generals availed themselves. Annius Gallus was placed in command of these forces with Vestricius <a id="id_1fnm232"/>Spurinna,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn232" class="fnnum pginternal">232</a> and they were sent forward to hold the line of the Po. Their first plans had failed, <a id="id_1page121"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="121"></a>Caecina, whom Otho had hoped to hold within the Gallic provinces, having already crossed the <a id="id_1fnm233"/>Alps.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn233" class="fnnum pginternal">233</a> Under Otho's personal command marched picked detachments of his Body Guard and the rest of the Household troops, together with reservists of the Guard and a large force of <a id="id_1fnm234"/>marines.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn234" class="fnnum pginternal">234</a> He let no luxury either delay or disgrace his march. In an iron breast-plate he marched on foot at the head of his troops, looking rough and dishevelled, quite unlike his reputation.</p>
<p>Fortune smiled on his first efforts. <a id="IIchap12"/><span class="chapnum">12</span>By sea his fleet held most of the Italian coast right up to the foot of the Maritime Alps. To secure these mountains and attack the province of Narbonese Gaul he had placed in command Suedius Clemens, Antonius Novellus, and Aemilius <a id="id_1fnm235"/>Pacensis.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn235" class="fnnum pginternal">235</a> Pacensis, however, was made a prisoner by his mutinous troops: Novellus had no authority: Clemens' command rested on popularity, and he was as greedy of battle as he was criminally blind to insubordination. No one could have imagined they were in Italy, on the soil of their native land. As though on foreign shores and among an enemy's towns, they burnt, ravaged, plundered, with results all the more horrible since no precautions had been taken against danger. The fields were full, the houses open. The inhabitants came to meet them with their wives and children, and were lured by the security <a id="id_1page122"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="122"></a>of peace into all the horrors of war. The Governor of the Maritime <a id="id_1fnm236"/>Alps<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn236" class="fnnum pginternal">236</a> at that time was Marius Maturus. He summoned the inhabitants, whose fighting strength was ample, and proposed to resist at the frontier the Othonians' invasion of the province. But at the first engagement the mountaineers were cut down and dispersed. They had assembled in random haste; they knew nothing of military service or discipline, nothing of the glory of victory or the disgrace of flight.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap13"/><span class="chapnum">13</span>Enraged by this engagement, Otho's troops visited their indignation on the town of <a id="id_1fnm237"/>Albintimilium.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn237" class="fnnum pginternal">237</a> The battle had brought them no booty, for the peasants were poor and their armour worthless, and being swift of foot, with a good knowledge of the country, they had escaped capture. However, the soldiers sated their greed at the expense of the innocent town. A Ligurian woman afforded a fine example of courage which made their conduct the more odious. She had concealed her son, and when the soldiers, who believed that she had hidden some money as well, demanded from her under torture where she was keeping him concealed, she pointed to her belly and replied, 'He is in hiding.' No subsequent tortures nor even death itself could bring her to change that brave and noble answer.</p>
<p><a id="id_1page123"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="123"></a></p>
<p><a id="IIchap14"/><span class="chapnum">14</span>Panic-stricken couriers brought to Fabius Valens the news that Otho's fleet was threatening the province of Narbonese Gaul, which had sworn allegiance to Vitellius. Representatives from the Roman colonies also arrived beseeching his aid. He dispatched two cohorts of the <a id="id_1fnm238"/>Tungri<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn238" class="fnnum pginternal">238</a> and four troops of horse, together with the entire cavalry regiment of the <a id="id_1fnm239"/>Treviri.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn239" class="fnnum pginternal">239</a> This force was put under the command of Julius <a id="id_1fnm240"/>Classicus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn240" class="fnnum pginternal">240</a> and part of it was detained in the colony of Forum <a id="id_1fnm241"/>Julii,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn241" class="fnnum pginternal">241</a> since if the whole force marched inland and the sea-board were left unprotected Otho's fleet would swoop down at once. Twelve troops of cavalry and a picked body of auxiliaries marched against the enemy: these were reinforced by a Ligurian cohort which had long garrisoned this district, and a draft of five hundred Pannonian recruits who had not yet joined their legion.<a id="id_1fnm242"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn242" class="fnnum pginternal">242</a> The engagement began promptly. Their line was so arranged that some of the marines, reinforced by the peasants, held the rising ground by the sea, while the Guards filled the level space between the hills and the shore. The fleet, acting in conjunction with the land force, was ready to play its part in the battle, and extended a threatening front facing the coast. The Vitellians, weaker in infantry, put their <a id="id_1page124"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="124"></a>trust in their horse. The <a id="id_1fnm243"/>mountaineers<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn243" class="fnnum pginternal">243</a> were posted on the neighbouring heights, and the auxiliaries massed in close order behind the cavalry. The Treviran cavalry rashly charged the enemy, and meeting Otho's guards in front were simultaneously assailed in the flank by the peasants, flinging stones. This they could do well enough; and, drafted among the regulars, they all, bold and timid alike, showed the same courage in the hour of victory. Panic struck the defeated Vitellians when the fleet began to harass their rear. They were now surrounded, and would have been entirely destroyed had not darkness arrested the victors and sheltered their flight. <a id="IIchap15"/><span class="chapnum">15</span>But though beaten the Vitellians were not cowed. Calling up reinforcements, they suddenly attacked while the unsuspecting enemy were taking their ease after the victory. They killed the pickets, broke into the camp and terrified the sailors. In time the panic subsided. The Othonians seized a hill, defended their position, and eventually assumed the offensive. The slaughter was frightful. The officers commanding the Tungri, after a long defence of their position, fell beneath a shower of weapons. The victory also cost the Othonians heavy loss, for the enemy's cavalry rallied and cut off all who rashly ventured too far in pursuit. So they agreed to a sort of armistice. As a safeguard against sudden raids either by the fleet on the one side or the cavalry on the other, the Vitellians retired to Antipolis,<a id="id_1fnm244"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn244" class="fnnum pginternal">244</a> a <a id="id_1page125"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="125"></a>town of the Narbonese province, and the Othonians to <a id="id_1fnm245"/>Albingaunum<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn245" class="fnnum pginternal">245</a> in the interior of Liguria.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap16"/><span class="chapnum">16</span>The fame of this naval victory kept Corsica and Sardinia and the adjacent islands faithful to Otho's cause. However, Decumus Pacarius, the <a id="id_1fnm246"/>procurator,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn246" class="fnnum pginternal">246</a> nearly ruined Corsica by an act of indiscretion, which in a war of such dimensions could not possibly have affected the issue, and only ended in his own destruction. He hated Otho and determined to aid Vitellius with all the forces of Corsica; a useless assistance, even if it had been forthcoming. He summoned the chief men of the island and disclosed his project. Claudius Pyrrhicus, who commanded the Liburnian <a id="id_1fnm247"/>cruisers<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn247" class="fnnum pginternal">247</a> stationed there, and a Roman knight named <a id="id_1page126"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="126"></a>Quintius Certus ventured to oppose him. He ordered their execution. This overawed the others who were present. So they swore allegiance to Vitellius, as did also the general mass of ignorant people, who blindly shared a fear they did not feel. However, when Pacarius began to enlist them and to harass his undisciplined men with military duties, their loathing for the unwonted labour set them thinking of their weakness. 'They lived in an island: Vitellius' legions were in Germany, a long way off: Otho's fleet had already sacked and plundered districts that had even horse and foot to protect them.' The revulsion was sudden, but did not issue in overt resistance. They chose a suitable moment for their treachery. Waiting till Pacarius' <a id="id_1fnm248"/>visitors<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn248" class="fnnum pginternal">248</a> were gone, they murdered him, stripped and helpless, in his bath, and killed his comrades too. The heads they bore themselves to Otho, like enemies' scalps. Neither did Otho reward nor Vitellius punish them. In the general confusion their deed was overshadowed by more heinous crimes.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap17"/><span class="chapnum">17</span>We have already <a id="id_1fnm249"/>described<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn249" class="fnnum pginternal">249</a> how 'Silius' Horse' had admitted the war into the heart of Italy. No one there either supported Otho or preferred Vitellius. But prolonged peace had broken their spirits to utter servility. They were an easy prey to the first comer and cared little who was the better man. All the fields and cities between the Alps and the Po, the most fertile district in Italy, were held by the Vitellian forces, the cohorts sent forward by Caecina<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn249" class="fnnum pginternal">249</a> <a id="id_1page127"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="127"></a>having already arrived. One of the Pannonian cohorts had been captured at Cremona: a hundred cavalry and a thousand marines had been cut off between Placentia and Ticinum.<a id="id_1fnm250"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn250" class="fnnum pginternal">250</a> After this success the river and its steep banks were no barrier to the Vitellian troops: indeed the Batavians and other Germans found the Po a positive temptation. Crossing suddenly opposite Placentia, they captured a handful of scouts and created such a panic that the others in terror spread the false report that Caecina's whole army was upon them.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap18"/><span class="chapnum">18</span>Spurinna, who was holding Placentia, had made up his mind that Caecina had not yet arrived, and that, if he should, his troops must be kept within their lines: he could not pit three cohorts of guards with one detachment a thousand <a id="id_1fnm251"/>strong,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn251" class="fnnum pginternal">251</a> and a few cavalry, against Caecina's veteran army.

They even clamoured that Otho was being betrayed, and Caecina had been <a id="id_1fnm254"/>summoned.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn254" class="fnnum pginternal">254</a> Spurinna yielded unwillingly to their folly, at first under compulsion, later with a show of <a id="id_1page128"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="128"></a>sympathy.

<p><a id="IIchap19"/><span class="chapnum">19</span>At nightfall, with the Po in sight, Spurinna decided to entrench his <a id="id_1fnm255"/>camp.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn255" class="fnnum pginternal">255</a> The unaccustomed hard work soon blunted the enthusiasm of his town-bred troops. The older men began to curse their credulity, and to point out the fearful danger to their small force of being surrounded by Caecina's army in the open country. Soon a more sober spirit pervaded the camp. The tribunes and centurions mingled with the men, and every one talked with admiration of Spurinna's foresight in selecting a powerful and wealthy colony as a strong base for their operations. Finally Spurinna himself rather explained his plans than reproached their faults, and, leaving patrols behind, succeeded eventually in leading the rest of the men back to Placentia in a quieter and more submissive frame of mind. There the walls were repaired, outworks built, and the turrets increased in height and number, while Spurinna provided not only for arms and ammunition but also for obedience and discipline. This was all his party lacked, for their courage was unimpeachable.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap20"/><span class="chapnum">20</span>Caecina, on the other hand, seemed to have left <a id="id_1page129"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="129"></a>his cruelty and profligacy on the other side of the Alps. He marched through Italy with a well-disciplined force. The people in the country-towns and colonies took offence at his costume as showing arrogance. While they wore the plain toga, Caecina addressed them attired in a parti-coloured plaid and <a id="id_1fnm256"/>trousers.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn256" class="fnnum pginternal">256</a> Moreover, his wife Salonina rode on a fine horse with purple trappings, and though this did no one any harm, they grumbled and seemed hurt. It is an ineradicable human trait to turn critical eyes on new-found fortune, and to insist upon moderation most of all in those who used to be our equals. Crossing the Po, Caecina tried to undermine the loyalty of the Othonians by negotiations and promises. They retaliated with the same weapons, and when they had finished bandying empty and fine-sounding phrases about Peace and Union, Caecina devoted all his attention and plans to an assault on Placentia in terrific force. He knew that his future reputation rested on the issue of his first engagements.<a id="id_1fnm257"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn257" class="fnnum pginternal">257</a></p>
<p><a id="IIchap21"/><span class="chapnum">21</span>But the first day's work savoured more of impatience than of a veteran army's methods. The men ventured under the walls without cover or precaution, drunk and overfed. Meanwhile the amphitheatre, a fine <a id="id_1page130"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="130"></a>building outside the walls, was burnt down. It was set on fire either by the attacking force hurling torches and heated shot and fire-brands, or by the besieged in returning their fire. The common people of the town harboured a suspicion that fuel for the fire had been surreptitiously introduced from one of the neighbouring colonies, and that the motive was jealousy, since no building in Italy could hold so many people. However it happened, they thought little of it, while worse disasters threatened: safety assured, they bewailed it as the worst calamity they could have suffered. To return, however, to Caecina: he was repulsed with heavy losses, and the night was spent in preparations. The Vitellians provided mantlets, fascines, and <a id="id_1fnm258"/>penthouses,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn258" class="fnnum pginternal">258</a> to protect the assailants while undermining the walls: the Othonians procured stakes and huge masses of stone or lead or brass, to break through the enemy's formation and crush them to pieces. Both parties were actuated by feelings of pride and ambition. Various encouragements were used, one side praising the strength of the legions and the German army, the other the reputation of the Guards and the City Garrison. The Vitellians decried their enemy as lazy effeminates demoralized by the circus and the theatre: to which they replied that the Vitellians were a pack of foreigners and barbarians. <a id="id_1page131"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="131"></a>Meanwhile, Otho and Vitellius were held up to praise or blame, insult providing the more fruitful stimulus.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap22"/><span class="chapnum">22</span>Hardly had day dawned before the walls of Placentia bristled with defenders, and the fields glittered with the soldiers' armour. The Vitellian <a id="id_1fnm259"/>legions<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn259" class="fnnum pginternal">259</a> advancing in close order with their auxiliaries in scattered bands assailed the higher portions of the walls with stones and arrows: where the walls were in disrepair or crumbling from age they came close up to them. The Othonians above, poising and aiming their weapons with surer effect, rained them down on the Germans, who came rashly charging under the walls with the wild songs and scanty dress of their country, brandishing their shields over their heads. Meanwhile, the legionaries under cover of their mantlets and fascines set to work to undermine the walls, build up a mound, and assail the gates, while Otho's Guards rolled on to them with terrific crashes huge millstones, which they had arranged for this purpose along the walls. Of those beneath, some were crushed by the stones; others, wounded by darts, were left mangled and bleeding to death. Panic redoubled the slaughter, and the rain of missiles came all the fiercer from the walls. At last they sacrificed the honour of their party and beat a retreat. Caecina, ashamed of his rash attempt at assault, was afraid of looking ridiculous and useless if he sat still in the same camp. So he crossed the Po <a id="id_1page132"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="132"></a>and made for Cremona. As he was retiring, Turullius Cerialis with a large force of marines, and Julius <a id="id_1fnm260"/>Briganticus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn260" class="fnnum pginternal">260</a> with a few cavalry, came over to his side. The latter, a Batavian born, had held a cavalry command: the former was a senior centurion, who was known to Caecina, as he had served in that capacity in Germany.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap23"/><span class="chapnum">23</span>Spurinna, learning the enemy's route, informed Annius <a id="id_1fnm261"/>Gallus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn261" class="fnnum pginternal">261</a> by letter of all that had happened, the defence of Placentia and Caecina's plans. Gallus was leading the First legion to the relief of Placentia, for he doubted the ability of the weak force of Guards to resist a long siege and the full strength of the German army. Hearing that Caecina was defeated and making for Cremona, he halted at Bedriacum, though he found it hard to restrain the ardour of his troops, whose zeal for battle nearly broke into mutiny. The village of Bedriacum lies between Verona and Cremona,<a id="id_1fnm262"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn262" class="fnnum pginternal">262</a> and two Roman disasters have now given it a sinister notoriety.</p>
<p>In the same week Martius <a id="id_1fnm263"/>Macer<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn263" class="fnnum pginternal">263</a> gained a victory in the neighbourhood of Cremona. With great enterprise he had transported his gladiators across the Po, and suddenly flung them on to the opposite bank. There <a id="id_1page133"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="133"></a>they routed the Vitellian auxiliaries and killed all who offered resistance, the rest taking flight to Cremona. But Macer checked their victorious ardour, for fear that the enemy might be reinforced and reverse the fortune of the battle. This aroused suspicion among the Othonians, who put a bad construction on all that their generals did. All the least courageous and most impudent of the troops vied incessantly with each other in bringing various charges against Annius Gallus, Suetonius Paulinus, and Marius Celsus, for the two latter had also been placed in command by <a id="id_1fnm264"/>Otho.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn264" class="fnnum pginternal">264</a> The most energetic in promoting mutiny and dissension were Galba's murderers, who, maddened by their feelings of fear and of guilt, created endless disorder, sometimes talking open sedition, sometimes sending anonymous letters to Otho. As he always believed men of the meaner sort and distrusted patriots, he now wavered nervously, being always irresolute in success and firmer in the face of danger. He therefore sent for his brother <a id="id_1fnm265"/>Titianus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn265" class="fnnum pginternal">265</a> and gave him the chief command.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap24"/><span class="chapnum">24</span>Meanwhile success attended the generalship of Paulinus and Celsus.<a id="id_1fnm266"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn266" class="fnnum pginternal">266</a> Caecina was tortured by his constant failure and the waning reputation of his <a id="id_1page134"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="134"></a>army. Repulsed from Placentia, he had lately seen his auxiliaries defeated, and his patrols constantly worsted in skirmishes more frequent than memorable. Now that Fabius Valens was close at hand, he determined not to let all the glory of the war fall to him, and hastened with more zeal than prudence to retrieve his reputation. About twelve <a id="id_1fnm267"/>miles<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn267" class="fnnum pginternal">267</a> distant from Cremona, at a place called <i>Twin Brethren</i>,<a id="id_1fnm268"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn268" class="fnnum pginternal">268</a> he carefully concealed the bravest of his auxiliaries in a wood overlooking the road. The cavalry were ordered to ride forward down the road and provoke an engagement. They were then to feign flight and lure the pursuers on in hot haste until they fell into the ambush. This plan was betrayed to Otho's generals. Paulinus took charge of the infantry, Celsus of the horse. A detachment of the Thirteenth legion,<a id="id_1fnm269"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn269" class="fnnum pginternal">269</a> four auxiliary cohorts of foot, and five hundred cavalry were stationed on the left flank. Three cohorts of the Guards in column occupied the raised high-road.<a id="id_1fnm270"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn270" class="fnnum pginternal">270</a> On the right flank marched the First legion, two auxiliary cohorts of foot, and five hundred cavalry. Besides these they moved out a thousand cavalry—Guards and auxiliaries—as a reserve to crown their success, or assist them in difficulties.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap25"/><span class="chapnum">25</span>Before they came to close quarters, the Vitellians began to retire. Celsus, forewarned of the ruse, <a id="id_1page135"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="135"></a>halted his men. Whereupon the Vitellians impatiently rose from their ambush and, while Celsus slowly retired, followed him further and further until they plunged headlong into an ambush themselves. The auxiliaries were on their flanks; the legions faced them in front; and the cavalry by a sudden manœuvre had closed in on their rear. However, Suetonius Paulinus did not immediately give the signal for his infantry to charge. He was by nature dilatory, and preferred cautiously reasoned measures to accidental success. He kept on issuing orders about filling up the ditches, clearing the fields and extending the line, convinced that it was soon enough to play for victory when he had taken every precaution against defeat. This delay gave the Vitellians time to take refuge in the vineyards, where the interlaced vine-stems made it hard to follow. Adjoining these was a little wood, from under cover of which they ventured another sally and killed the foremost of the Guards' cavalry. There Prince <a id="id_1fnm271"/>Epiphanes<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn271" class="fnnum pginternal">271</a> was wounded, while making vigorous efforts to rally Otho's forces.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap26"/><span class="chapnum">26</span>At this point Otho's infantry charged, crushed the opposing line, and even routed the troops who were hurrying up in support. For Caecina had brought up his reinforcements not all at once but in separate detachments. These, arriving in scattered units, and never in sufficient force, only added to the confusion, since the panic of the rout infected them as well. <a id="id_1page136"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="136"></a>Mutiny, too, broke out in the camp, because the troops were not all taken into battle. Julius Gratus, the camp-prefect, was put in irons on a charge of plotting with his brother, who was fighting on Otho's side. It was known that the Othonians had arrested the brother, Julius Fronto, on the same charge. For the rest, such was the universal panic among pursuers and pursued, on the field and in the camp, that it was commonly said on both sides that, if Suetonius Paulinus had not sounded the retreat, Caecina's whole army might have been destroyed. Paulinus maintained that he avoided any excessive strain of work or marching, for fear of exposing his exhausted troops to a counter-attack from the Vitellians in the camp, who were still fresh for battle: besides, he had no reserves to fall back on in case of defeat. A few approved of the general's strategy, but the common opinion was adverse.<a id="id_1fnm272"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-6.htm.html#id_1fn272" class="fnnum pginternal">272</a></p>
