<p><a id="Ichap67"/><span class="chapnum">67</span>There was even more looting and bloodshed on Caecina's march. The Helvetii, a Gallic <a id="id_1fnm138"/>tribe<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn138" class="fnnum pginternal">138</a> once famous as fighting men and still distinguished by the memory of their past, having heard nothing of Galba's murder, refused to acknowledge the authority of Vitellius. This exasperated Caecina's headstrong nature. Hostilities broke out owing to the greed and impatience of the Twenty-first legion, who had seized a sum of money which was being sent to pay the garrison of a fort in which the Helvetii used to keep native troops at their own <a id="id_1fnm139"/>expense.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn139" class="fnnum pginternal">139</a> The Helvetii, highly indignant at this, intercepted a dispatch from the German army to the Pannonian legions, and kept a centurion and some men in custody. Greedy for battle, Caecina hastened to take immediate vengeance without giving them time for second thoughts. Promptly breaking up his camp, he proceeded to harry the country, and sacked a charming and much-frequented watering-place,<a id="id_1fnm140"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn140" class="fnnum pginternal">140</a> which had grown during the long peace into the size and importance of a town. Instructions were sent to the Raetian auxiliaries to attack the Helvetii in the rear, while their attention was occupied with the legion.</p>
<p><a id="id_1page84"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="84"></a></p>
<p><a id="Ichap68"/><span class="chapnum">68</span>Full of spirit beforehand, the Helvetii were terrified in the face of danger. At the first alarm they had chosen Claudius Severus general, but they knew nothing of fighting or discipline and were incapable of combined action. An engagement with the Roman veterans would be disastrous; and the walls, dilapidated by time, could not stand a siege. They found themselves between Caecina and his powerful army on the one side, and on the other the Raetian auxiliaries, both horse and foot, and the whole fighting force of Raetia as well, trained soldiers well used to <a id="id_1fnm141"/>fighting.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn141" class="fnnum pginternal">141</a> Their country was given over to plunder and massacre. Flinging away their arms, they wandered miserably between two fires. Wounded and scattered, most of them took refuge on the Bötzberg.<a id="id_1fnm142"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn142" class="fnnum pginternal">142</a> But some Thracian auxiliaries were promptly sent to dislodge them. The German army, aided by the Raetians, pursued them through the woods, and cut them to pieces in their hiding-places. Many thousands were killed and many sold as slaves. Having completed the work of destruction, the army advanced in hostile array against <a id="id_1fnm143"/>Aventicum,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn143" class="fnnum pginternal">143</a> their capital town, and were met by envoys offering surrender. The offer was accepted. Caecina executed Julius Alpinus, one of their chief men, as the prime instigator of the revolt. The rest he left to experience the clemency or cruelty of Vitellius.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap69"/><span class="chapnum">69</span></p>
<p>It is hard to say whether these envoys found Vitellius or the army the more implacable. The soldiers <a id="id_1page85"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="85"></a>clamoured for the destruction of the <a id="id_1fnm144"/>town,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn144" class="fnnum pginternal">144</a> and shook their fists and weapons in the envoys' faces: even Vitellius indulged in threatening language. Ultimately, however, Claudius Cossus, one of the envoys, a noted speaker who greatly enhanced the effect of his eloquence by concealing his skill under a well-timed affectation of nervousness, succeeded in softening the hearts of the soldiers. A mob is always liable to sudden changes of feeling, and the men were as sensible to pity as they had been extravagant in their brutality. Thus with streams of tears and importunate prayers for a better answer the envoys procured a free pardon for <a id="id_1fnm145"/>Aventicum.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn145" class="fnnum pginternal">145</a></p>
<p><a id="Ichap70"/><span class="chapnum">70</span>Caecina halted for a few days in Helvetian territory until he could get news of Vitellius' decision. Meantime, while carrying on his preparations for crossing the Alps, he received from Italy the joyful news that 'Silius' Horse',<a id="id_1fnm146"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn146" class="fnnum pginternal">146</a> stationed at Padua, had come over to Vitellius. The members of this troop had served under Vitellius when pro-consul in Africa. They had subsequently been detached under orders from Nero to precede him to Egypt, and had then been recalled, owing to the outbreak of the war with . They were now in Italy. Their officers, who knew nothing <a id="id_1page86"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="86"></a>of Otho and were attached to Vitellius, extolled the strength of the approaching column and the fame of the German army. So the troop went over to Vitellius, bringing their new emperor a gift of the four strongest towns of the Transpadane district, Milan, Novara, Eporedia,<a id="id_1fnm147"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn147" class="fnnum pginternal">147</a> and Vercelli. Of this they informed Caecina themselves. But one troop of horse could not garrison the whole of the widest part of Italy. Caecina accordingly hurried forward the Gallic, Lusitanian, and British auxiliaries, and some German detachments, together with 'Petra's Horse',<a id="id_1fnm148"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn148" class="fnnum pginternal">148</a> while he himself hesitated whether he should not cross the Raetian <a id="id_1fnm149"/>Alps<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn149" class="fnnum pginternal">149</a> into Noricum and attack the governor, Petronius Urbicus, who, having raised a force of irregulars and broken down the bridges, was supposed to be a faithful adherent of Otho. However, he was afraid of losing the auxiliaries whom he had sent on ahead, and at the same time he considered that there was more glory in holding Italy, and that, wherever the theatre of the war might be, Noricum was sure to be among the spoils of victory. So he chose the Pennine <a id="id_1fnm150"/>route<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn150" class="fnnum pginternal">150</a> and led his legionaries and the heavy marching column across the Alps, although they were still deep in <a id="id_1fnm151"/>snow.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn151" class="fnnum pginternal">151</a></p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00022"><a id="Othos_Government"/>Otho's Government and the Distribution of Forces</h3>
<p><a id="Ichap71"/><span class="chapnum">71</span>Meanwhile, contrary to all expectation, Otho was no prey to idle luxury. He postponed his pleasures and disguised his extravagance, suiting all his behaviour to the dignity of his position. But people knew they had not seen the last of his vices, and his virtuous hypocrisy only increased their alarm. He gave orders to summon Marius Celsus to the Capitol. This was the consul-elect whom he had rescued from the savage clutches of the soldiers by pretending to put him in <a id="id_1fnm152"/>prison.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn152" class="fnnum pginternal">152</a> Otho now wanted to earn a name for clemency by pardoning a well-known man, who had fought against his party. Celsus was firm. Pleading guilty to the charge of fidelity to Galba, he went on to show that he had set an example which was all to Otho's advantage. Otho treated him as if there was nothing to pardon. Calling on heaven to witness their reconciliation, he then and there admitted him to the circle of his intimate friends, and subsequently gave him an appointment as one of his generals. Celsus remained faithful to Otho too, doomed apparently to the losing side. His acquittal, which delighted the upper classes and was popular with the mass of the people, even earned the approval of the soldiers, who now admired the qualities which had previously aroused their indignation.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap72"/><span class="chapnum">72</span>Equal rejoicing, though for different reasons, <a id="id_1page88"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="88"></a>followed the long-looked-for downfall of Ofonius Tigellinus. Born of obscure parentage, he had grown from an immoral youth into a vicious old man. He rose to the command first of the <a id="id_1fnm153"/>Police,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn153" class="fnnum pginternal">153</a> and then of the Praetorian Guards, finding that vice was a short cut to such rewards of virtue. In these and other high offices he developed the vices of maturity, first cruelty, then greed. He corrupted Nero and introduced him to every kind of depravity; then ventured on some villainies behind his back, and finally deserted and betrayed him. Thus in his case, as in no other, those who hated Nero and those who wished him back agreed, though from different motives, in calling loudly for his execution. During Galba's reign he had been protected by the influence of Titus Vinius, on the plea that he had saved his daughter. Saved her he had, not from any feelings of pity (he had killed too many for that), but to secure a refuge for the future. For all such rascals, distrusting the present and fearing a change of fortune, always prepare for themselves a shelter against public indignation by obtaining the favour of private persons. So they rely to escape punishment not on their innocence but on a system of mutual insurance. People were all the more incensed against Tigellinus, since the recent feeling against Vinius was added to their old hatred for him. From all quarters of Rome they flocked to the palace and the squares; and above all, in the circus and the theatre, where the mob enjoys complete licence, they <a id="id_1page89"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="89"></a>assembled in crowds and broke out into riotous uproar. Eventually Tigellinus at Sinuessa <a id="id_1fnm154"/>Spa<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn154" class="fnnum pginternal">154</a> received the news that his last hour was inevitably come. There after a cowardly delay in the foul embraces of his prostitutes he cut his throat with a razor, and blackened the infamy of his life by a hesitating and shameful death.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap73"/><span class="chapnum">73</span>About the same time there arose a demand for the punishment of Calvia Crispinilla. But she was saved by various prevarications, and Otho's connivence cost him some discredit. This woman had tutored Nero in vice, and afterwards crossed to Africa to incite Clodius <a id="id_1fnm155"/>Macer<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn155" class="fnnum pginternal">155</a> to civil war. While there she openly schemed to start a famine in Rome. However, she secured herself by marrying an ex-consul, and lived to enjoy a wide popularity in Rome. She escaped harm under Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, and eventually wielded a great influence due to her being both rich and childless, considerations of the first importance in any state of society.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap74"/><span class="chapnum">74</span>During this time Otho wrote constantly to Vitellius, holding out various effeminate inducements, making him offers of money or an influential position, or any retreat he liked to select for a life of <a id="id_1fnm156"/>luxury.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn156" class="fnnum pginternal">156</a> Vitellius made similar offers. At first both wrote in the mildest tone, though the affectation on either side was stupid <a id="id_1page90"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="90"></a>and inappropriate. But they soon struck a quarrelsome note, and reproached each other with immorality and crime, both with a good deal of truth. Otho recalled the commission which Galba had sent out to <a id="id_1fnm157"/>Germany,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn157" class="fnnum pginternal">157</a> and, using the pretext of senatorial authority, sent fresh commissioners to both the armies in Germany, and also to the Italian legion, and the troops quartered at Lugdunum. However, the commissioners remained with Vitellius with a readiness which showed they were under no compulsion; and the guards who had been attached to them, ostensibly as a mark of honour, were sent back at once before they had time to mix with the legionary soldiers. Further than this, Fabius Valens sent letters in the name of the German army to the Guards and the City Garrison, extolling the strength of his own side and offering to join forces. He even went so far as to reproach them with having transferred to Otho the title which had long <a id="id_1fnm158"/>before<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn158" class="fnnum pginternal">158</a> been conferred on Vitellius. <a id="Ichap75"/><span class="chapnum">75</span>Thus they were assailed with threats as well as promises, and told that they were not strong enough to fight, and had nothing to lose by making peace. But, in spite of all, the fidelity of the Guards remained unchanged. However, Otho dispatched assassins to Germany, Vitellius to Rome. Neither met with success. Vitellius' assassins were lost <a id="id_1page91"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="91"></a>in the crowds of Rome, where nobody knows anybody, and thus escaped detection: Otho's were betrayed by their strange faces, since the troops all knew each other by sight. Vitellius then composed a letter to Otho's brother <a id="id_1fnm159"/>Titianus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn159" class="fnnum pginternal">159</a> threatening that his life and his son's should answer for the safety of Vitellius' mother and children. As it happened neither household suffered. Fear was perhaps the reason in Otho's time, but Vitellius, after his victory, could certainly claim credit for clemency.</p>
<p>The first news which gave Otho any degree of confidence <a id="Ichap76"/><span class="chapnum">76</span>was the announcement from Illyricum that the legions of Dalmatia and Pannonia and <a id="id_1fnm160"/>Moesia<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn160" class="fnnum pginternal">160</a> had sworn allegiance to him. Similar news arrived from Spain, and Cluvius <a id="id_1fnm161"/>Rufus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn161" class="fnnum pginternal">161</a> was commended in a special decree, but it was found out immediately afterwards that Spain had gone over to Vitellius. Even Aquitania soon fell away, although Julius Cordus had sworn in the province for Otho. Loyalty and affection seemed dead: men changed from one side to the other under the stress of fear or compulsion. It was fear which gave Vitellius the Province of Narbonese <a id="id_1fnm162"/>Gaul,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn162" class="fnnum pginternal">162</a> for it is easy to go over when the big battalions are so near. The distant provinces and the troops across the sea all remained at Otho's disposal, but not from any enthusiasm for <a id="id_1page92"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="92"></a>his cause; what weighed with them was the name of Rome and the title of the senate. Besides, Otho had got the first hearing. Vespasian swore in the Jewish <a id="id_1fnm163"/>army<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn163" class="fnnum pginternal">163</a> for Otho, and Mucianus the legions in Syria;<a id="id_1fnm164"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn164" class="fnnum pginternal">164</a> Egypt too and all the provinces towards the East were held for him. He also received the submission of Africa, where Carthage had taken the lead, without waiting for the sanction of the governor, Vipstanus Apronianus. Crescens, one of Nero's freedmen—in evil days these creatures play a part in <a id="id_1fnm165"/>politics<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn165" class="fnnum pginternal">165</a>—had given the common people of the town a gala dinner in honour of the new emperor, with the result that the inhabitants hurried into various excesses. The other African communities followed the example of Carthage.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap77"/><span class="chapnum">77</span>The provinces and their armies being thus divided, Vitellius could only win the throne by fighting. Otho meanwhile was carrying on the government as if the time were one of profound peace. Sometimes he consulted the country's dignity, though more often the exigencies of the moment forced him into unseemly haste. He held the consulship himself with his brother Titianus as colleague until the first of March. For the next two months he appointed Verginius, as a sort of sop to the army in <a id="id_1fnm166"/>Germany.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn166" class="fnnum pginternal">166</a> As colleague he gave <a id="id_1page93"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="93"></a>him Pompeius Vopiscus, ostensibly because he was an old friend of his own, but it was generally understood as a compliment to <a id="id_1fnm167"/>Vienne.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn167" class="fnnum pginternal">167</a> For the rest of the year the appointments which Nero or Galba had made were allowed to stand. The brothers Caelius and Flavius <a id="id_1fnm168"/>Sabinus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn168" class="fnnum pginternal">168</a> were consuls for June and July, Arrius <a id="id_1fnm169"/>Antoninus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn169" class="fnnum pginternal">169</a> and Marius Celsus for August and September; even Vitellius after his victory did not cancel their appointment. To the pontifical and augural colleges Otho either nominated old ex-magistrates, as the final crown of their career, or else, when young aristocrats returned from exile, he instated them by way of recompense in the pontifical posts which their fathers or grandfathers had held. He restored Cadius Rufus, Pedius Blaesus, and <i>Saevinus Proculus</i><a id="id_1fnm170"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn170" class="fnnum pginternal">170</a> to their seats in the senate. They had been convicted during Claudius' and Nero's reigns of extortion in the provinces. In pardoning them the name of their offence was changed, and their greed appeared as 'treason'. For so unpopular was the law of treason that it sapped the force of better <a id="id_1fnm171"/>statutes.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn171" class="fnnum pginternal">171</a></p>
<p><a id="Ichap78"/><span class="chapnum">78</span>Otho next tried to win over the municipalities and provincial towns by similar bribes. At the colonies <a id="id_1page94"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="94"></a>of Hispalis and <a id="id_1fnm172"/>Emerita<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn172" class="fnnum pginternal">172</a> he enrolled new families of settlers, granted the franchise to the whole community of the <a id="id_1fnm173"/>Lingones,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn173" class="fnnum pginternal">173</a> and made over certain Moorish towns as a gift to the province of Baetica. Cappadocia and Africa were also granted new privileges, as showy as they were short-lived. All these grants are excused by the exigences of the moment and the impending crisis, but he even found time to remember his old amours and passed a measure through the senate restoring Poppaea's <a id="id_1fnm174"/>statues.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn174" class="fnnum pginternal">174</a> He is believed also to have thought of celebrating Nero's memory as a means of attracting public sympathy. Some persons actually erected statues of Nero, and there were times when the populace and the soldiers, by way of enhancing his fame and dignity, saluted him as Nero Otho. However, he refused to commit himself. He was ashamed to accept the title, yet afraid to forbid its use.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap79"/><span class="chapnum">79</span>While the whole of Rome was intent upon the civil war, foreign affairs were neglected. Consequently a Sarmatian tribe called the <a id="id_1fnm175"/>Rhoxolani,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn175" class="fnnum pginternal">175</a> who had cut up two cohorts of auxiliaries in the previous winter, <a id="id_1page95"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="95"></a>now formed the still more daring scheme of invading Moesia. Inspirited by success, they assembled nearly 9,000 mounted men, all more intent on plunder than on fighting. While they were riding about aimlessly without any suspicion of danger, they were suddenly attacked by the Third <a id="id_1fnm176"/>legion<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn176" class="fnnum pginternal">176</a> and its native auxiliaries. On the Roman side everything was ready for a battle: the Sarmatians were scattered over the country; some in their greed for plunder were heavily laden, and their horses could scarcely move on the slippery roads. They were caught in a trap and cut to pieces. It is quite extraordinary how all a Sarmatian's courage is, so to speak, outside himself. Fighting on foot, no one is more cowardly; but their cavalry charge would break almost any troops. On this occasion it was raining and the ground was greasy with thaw; their pikes and their long swords, needing both hands to wield, were useless; their horses slipped and they were encumbered by the heavy coat of mail which all their chiefs and nobles wear. Being made of iron plates and a very hard kind of leather, it is impenetrable to blows, but most inconvenient for any one who is knocked down by a charge of the enemy and tries to get up. Besides, they sank into the deep, soft snow. The Roman soldiers in their neat leather jerkins, armed with javelin and lance, and using, if need be, their light swords, sprang on the unarmed Sarmatians (they never carry shields) and stabbed them at close quarters. A few, surviving the battle, hid <a id="id_1page96"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="96"></a>themselves in the marshes, and there perished miserably from the severity of the winter and their wounds. When the news of this reached Rome, Marcus Aponius, the governor of Moesia, was granted a triumphal <a id="id_1fnm177"/>statue,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn177" class="fnnum pginternal">177</a> while the commanding officers of the legions, Fulvius Aurelius, Tettius Julianus, and Numisius Lupus, received the insignia of consular rank. Otho was delighted and took all the credit to himself, as if he had been the successful general, and had himself employed his officers and armies to enlarge the empire.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap80"/><span class="chapnum">80</span>In the meantime a riot broke out in an unexpected quarter, and, though trivial at first, nearly ended in the destruction of Rome. Otho had given orders that the Seventeenth <a id="id_1fnm178"/>cohort<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn178" class="fnnum pginternal">178</a> should be summoned from the colony of Ostia to the city, and Varius Crispinus, a tribune of the guards, was instructed to provide them with arms. Anxious to carry out his instructions undisturbed while the camp was quiet, he arranged that the arsenal was to be opened and the cohort's wagons loaded after nightfall. The hour aroused suspicion; the motive was questioned; his choice of a quiet moment resulted in an uproar. The mere sight of swords made the drunken soldiers long to use them. They began to murmur and accuse their officers of treachery, suggesting that the senators' slaves were going to be armed against Otho. Some of <a id="id_1page97"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="97"></a>them were too fuddled to know what they were saying: the rascals saw a chance of plunder: the mass of them, as usual, were simply eager for a change: and such as were loyal could not carry out their orders in the darkness. When Crispinus tried to check them, the mutineers killed him together with the most determined of the centurions, seized their armour, bared their swords, and mounting the horses, made off at full speed for Rome and the palace.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap81"/><span class="chapnum">81</span>It so happened that a large party of Roman senators and their wives was dining with Otho. In their alarm they wondered whether the soldiers' outbreak was unpremeditated or a ruse of the emperor's: would it be safer to fly in all directions or to stay and be arrested? At one moment they would make a show of firmness, at the next their terror betrayed them. All the time they were watching Otho's face, and, as happens when people suspect each other, he was just as afraid himself as they were of him. But feeling no less alarm for the senators than for himself, he promptly dispatched the prefects of the Guards to appease the anger of the troops, and told all his guests to leave immediately. Then on all sides Roman officials could be seen to throw away their insignia, avoid their suite, and slink off unattended. Old gentlemen and their wives roamed the dark streets in all directions. Few went home, most of them fled to friends, or sought an obscure refuge with the humblest of their clients.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap82"/><span class="chapnum">82</span>The soldiers' onrush could not be stopped at the gates of the palace. They demanded to see Otho and <a id="id_1page98"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="98"></a>invaded the banquet-hall. Julius Martialis, a tribune of the Guards, and Vitellius Saturninus, the camp-prefect<a id="id_1fnm179"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn179" class="fnnum pginternal">179</a> of the legion, were wounded while endeavouring to bar their progress. On every side they brandished swords and hurled threats, now against their officers, now against the whole senate; and since they could not select any one victim for their wrath, in a blind frenzy of panic they clamoured for a free hand against all the senators. At last Otho, sacrificing his dignity, stood up on a couch and with great difficulty restrained them by means of prayers and tears. They returned to their camp unwillingly, and with a guilty conscience.</p>
<p>The next day Rome was like a captured city. The houses were all shut, the streets almost deserted, and everybody looked depressed. The soldiers, too, hung their heads, though they were more sulky than sorry for what they had done. Their prefects, Licinius Proculus and Plotius Firmus, harangued them by companies, the one mildly, the other harshly, for they were men of different natures. They concluded by announcing that the men were to receive five thousand <a id="id_1page99"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="99"></a>sesterces<a id="id_1fnm180"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn180" class="fnnum pginternal">180</a> apiece. After that Otho ventured to enter the camp. The tribunes and centurions each flinging away the insignia of his rank,<a id="id_1fnm181"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn181" class="fnnum pginternal">181</a> crowded round him begging for a safe discharge. Stung by the disgrace of this, the troops soon quieted down, and even went the length of demanding that the ringleaders should be punished. <a id="Ichap83"/><span class="chapnum">83</span>In the general disturbance Otho's position was difficult. The soldiers were by no means unanimous. The better sort wanted him to put a stop to the prevalent insubordination, but the great bulk of them liked faction-fighting and emperors who had to court their favour, and with the prospect of rioting and plunder were ready enough for civil war. He realized, also, that one who wins a throne by violence cannot keep it by suddenly trying to enforce the rigid discipline of earlier days. However, the danger of the crisis both for the city and the senate seriously alarmed him, so he finally delivered himself as follows:—</p>
<p>'Fellow soldiers, I have not come to fan the fire of your affection for me, or to instil courage into your hearts: in both those qualities you are more than rich. No, I have come to ask you to moderate your courage and to set some bounds to your affection. These recent disturbances did not originate in those passions of greed or violence, which so often cause <a id="id_1page100"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="100"></a>dissension in an army; nor was it that you feared some danger and tried to shirk it. The sole cause was your excessive loyalty, which you displayed with more ardour than judgement. For with the best of motives, indiscretion often lands men in disaster. We are preparing for war. Do you imagine that we could publish all our dispatches, and discuss our plans in the presence of the whole army, when we have to devise a systematic campaign and keep up with the rapid changes of the situation? There are things a soldier ought to know, but there is much of which he must be ignorant. It is necessary for the maintenance of strict discipline and of the general's authority that even his tribunes and centurions should often obey blindly. If every one is going to inquire into his motives, discipline is done for, and his authority falls to the ground. Suppose in actual warfare you are called to arms at dead of night: shall a few drunken blackguards—for I cannot believe that many lost their heads in the recent panic—go and stain their hands with their officers' blood, and then break into the general's tent?</p>
<p><a id="Ichap84"/><span class="chapnum">84</span>'Now I know you did it to protect me, but the riot and the darkness and the general confusion might easily have provided an opportunity to kill me. Suppose Vitellius and his satellites had their choice of the state of mind they would pray to find us in; what more could they desire than mutiny and dissension, the men insubordinate to the centurions, and the centurions to their superior officers, and the whole force, horse and foot alike, rushing in headlong confusion to <a id="id_1page101"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="101"></a>their ruin? Good soldiering, my comrades, consists in obedience, not in scrutinizing the general's orders; and the army which is most orderly in peace is most courageous on the field of battle. Yours are the swords and the courage; you must leave it to me to plan the campaign, and to direct your valour. The culprits were but few, and only two are to be punished; the rest of you must blot out all memory of that discreditable night. No army must ever hear again such words spoken against the senate. It is the brain of the empire and the glory of all the provinces. Why, in Heaven's name, the very Germans themselves, whom Vitellius is stirring up with all his might against us, would not dare to call its members into question! Shall it be said that Italy's own sons, the real soldiery of Rome, are clamouring to murder and massacre the very senators whose lustre it is that throws into the shade the obscure and vulgar adherents of Vitellius? Vitellius has seized a few provinces and raised a sort of shadow of an army; but the senate is on our side. Therefore, Rome is for us; they are against her. Do you imagine that the stability of this beautiful city consists in houses and edifices built of stone upon stone? Nay, they are dumb inanimate things that may fall to pieces and be rebuilt at pleasure. The eternity of our empire, the peace of the world, your welfare and mine, all depend upon the safety of the senate. Instituted with solemn ceremony by the father and founder of Rome, the senate has come down in undying continuity from the kings to the emperors; and as we have received <a id="id_1page102"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="102"></a>it from our ancestors, so let us hand it on to our posterity. From your ranks come the senators, and from the senate come the emperors of Rome.'</p>
<p><a id="Ichap85"/><span class="chapnum">85</span>This speech, as being well calculated to provide a reprimand and a sedative for the soldiers, and Otho's moderation—for he only ordered the punishment of two men—were well received. He had calmed for a moment the troops he could not control. Yet peace and quiet were not restored in Rome. One could still detect the clash of arms and the lurid face of war. Refraining from organized riot, the soldiers now dispersed to private houses and lived in disguise, giving vent to their bad feeling by maligning all whom nobility of birth or wealth or any other distinction made a mark for scandal. Many, besides, believed that some of Vitellius' soldiers had come to Rome to study the state of party feeling. Everywhere suspicion was rife, and terror invaded even the privacy of the home. But far greater was the alarm displayed in public places. With every fresh piece of news that rumour brought, men's feelings and the expression on their faces changed. They were afraid to be found lacking in confidence when things looked doubtful, or in joy when they went well for Otho. Above all, when the senate was summoned to the House, they found it extraordinarily hard always to strike the right note. Silence would argue arrogance; plain speaking would arouse suspicion; yet flattery would be detected by Otho, who had so lately been a private citizen, practising the art himself. So they had to <a id="id_1page103"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="103"></a>turn and twist their sentences. Vitellius they called enemy and traitor, the more prudent confining themselves to such vague generalities. A few ventured to fling the truth at him, but they always chose a moment of uproar when a great many people were all shouting at once, or else they talked so loud and fast as to drown their own words.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap86"/><span class="chapnum">86</span>Another cause of alarm was the various portents vouched for by many witnesses. In the Capitoline Square, it was said, the figure of Victory had let the reins of her chariot slip from her hands: a ghost of superhuman size had suddenly burst out of the chapel of Juno:<a id="id_1fnm182"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn182" class="fnnum pginternal">182</a> a statue of the sainted Julius on the island in the Tiber had, on a fine, still day, turned round from the west and faced the east: an ox had spoken in Etruria: animals had given birth to strange monsters. Many were the stories of these occurrences, which in primitive ages are observed even in time of peace, though now we only hear of them in time of panic. But the greatest damage at the moment, and the greatest alarm for the future, was caused by a sudden rising of the Tiber. Immensely swollen, it carried away the bridge on <a id="id_1fnm183"/>piles,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn183" class="fnnum pginternal">183</a> and, its current being stemmed by the heavy ruins, it flooded not only the flat, low-lying portions of the city, but also districts <a id="id_1page104"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="104"></a>that seemed safe from inundation. Many people were swept away in the streets, still more were overtaken by the flood in shops or in their beds at home. The result was a famine, since food was <a id="id_1fnm184"/>scarce,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-4.htm.html#id_1fn184" class="fnnum pginternal">184</a> and the poor were deprived of their means of livelihood. Blocks of flats, the foundations of which had rotted in the standing water, collapsed when the river sank. No sooner had the panic caused by the flood subsided than it was found that, whereas Otho was preparing an expedition, its route over the Martian Plain and up the Flaminian Road was blocked. Though probably caused by chance, or the course of Nature, this mishap was turned into a miraculous omen of impending disaster.</p>

It seems most likely to mean the same as <i>praefectus castrorum</i>, an officer who superintended the camp and sometimes acted as second-in-command (cp. ii. <a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#IIchap89" class="pginternal">89</a>). The post was one to which senior centurions could rise. At this period they were not attached to a legion, but to a camp, where more than one legion might be quartered. That makes the phrase here used curious. The legion is that of the marines now stationed in Rome (cp. chaps. <a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#Ichap6" class="pginternal">6</a> and <a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#Ichap9" class="pginternal">9</a>).

<h3 id="pgepubid00023"><a id="Othos_Plans"/>Otho's Plans</h3>
<p><a id="Ichap87"/><span class="chapnum">87</span>Otho had held a purification of the <a id="id_1fnm185"/>city<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn185" class="fnnum pginternal">185</a> and meditated his plans for the war. Recognizing that the Pennine and Cottian Alps and all the other passes into Gaul were held by Vitellius, he decided to invade Narbonese Gaul by sea. His fleet was now a strong and reliable arm, devoted to his cause. For he had formed the full strength of a legion out of the survivors of the Mulvian Bridge massacre,<a id="id_1fnm186"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn186" class="fnnum pginternal">186</a> whom Galba's cruelty had <a id="id_1page105"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="105"></a>kept in prison, and to all the marines he had held out hopes of honourable <a id="id_1fnm187"/>service.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn187" class="fnnum pginternal">187</a> To the fleet he attached the cohorts of the City Garrison and a large force of Guards. These were the flower of the army and its chief strength, well able to advise their own generals and to take good care of them. The command of the expedition was entrusted to Antonius Novellus and Suedius Clemens, both senior <a id="id_1fnm188"/>centurions,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn188" class="fnnum pginternal">188</a> and to Aemilius Pacensis, to whom Otho had restored his <a id="id_1fnm189"/>commission,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn189" class="fnnum pginternal">189</a> of which Galba had deprived him. In charge of the fleet he still retained the freedman <a id="id_1fnm190"/>Moschus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn190" class="fnnum pginternal">190</a> to keep an eye on his betters. In command of the cavalry and infantry he placed Suetonius Paulinus, Marius Celsus, and Annius Gallus, but the man in whom he put most faith was the Prefect of the Guards, Licinius Proculus. This officer had shown himself efficient in garrison service, but was without any experience of warfare. He maligned the characteristic virtues of his colleagues, Paulinus' power of influence, Celsus' energy, Gallus' ripe judgement, and being a knave and no fool, he easily got the better of men who were both honest and loyal.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap88"/><span class="chapnum">88</span>It was about this time that Cornelius <a id="id_1fnm191"/>Dolabella<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn191" class="fnnum pginternal">191</a> was banished to the colony of <a id="id_1fnm192"/>Aquinum,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn192" class="fnnum pginternal">192</a> though not <a id="id_1page106"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="106"></a>kept in close or dishonourable confinement. There was no charge against him: the stigma upon him was his ancient name and <a id="id_1fnm193"/>kinship<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn193" class="fnnum pginternal">193</a> to Galba. Otho issued orders that several of the magistrates and a large number of ex-consuls were to join the expedition, not to take part in the campaign or to assist in any way, but simply as a friendly escort. Among these was Lucius Vitellius, whom he treated neither as an emperor's brother nor as the brother of an enemy, but just like anybody else. Much anxiety was aroused for the safety of the city, where all classes feared danger. The leading members of the senate were old and infirm, and enervated by a long period of peace: the aristocracy were inefficient and had forgotten how to fight: the knights knew nothing of military service. The more they all tried to conceal their alarm, the more obvious it became. Some of them, on the other hand, went in for senseless display, and purchased beautiful armour and fine horses: others procured as provisions of war elaborate dinner-services or some other contrivance to stimulate a jaded taste. Prudent men were concerned for the country's peace: the frivolous, without a thought for the future, were inflated by empty hopes: a good many, whose loss of credit made peace unwelcome, were delighted at the general unrest, feeling safer among uncertainties. <a id="Ichap89"/><span class="chapnum">89</span>Though the cares of state were too vast to arouse any interest in the masses, yet as the price of food rose, and the whole revenue was devoted to military purposes, the common <a id="id_1page107"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="107"></a>people gradually began to realize the evils of war. During the revolt of they had not suffered so much. Being carried on in the provinces between the legionaries and the natives of Gaul it was to all intents a foreign war, and the city had not been affected. For from the time when the sainted Augustus organized the rule of the Caesars the wars of the Roman people had been fought in distant countries: all the anxiety and all the glory fell to the emperor alone. Under Tiberius and Caligula the country only suffered from the evils of <a id="id_1fnm194"/>peace.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn194" class="fnnum pginternal">194</a> Scribonianus' rising against Claudius was no sooner heard of than <a id="id_1fnm195"/>crushed.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn195" class="fnnum pginternal">195</a> Nero had been dethroned more by rumours and dispatches than by force of arms. But now not only the legions and the fleet, but, as had seldom happened before, the Guards and the City Garrison were called out for the campaign. Behind them were the East and the West and all the forces of the empire, material for a long war under any other generals. An attempt was made to delay Otho's departure by pointing out the impiety of his not having replaced the sacred shields in the temple of Mars.<a id="id_1fnm196"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn196" class="fnnum pginternal">196</a> But delay had ruined Nero: Otho would have none of it. And the knowledge that Caecina <a id="id_1page108"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="108"></a>had already crossed the <a id="id_1fnm197"/>Alps<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn197" class="fnnum pginternal">197</a> acted as a further stimulus.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap90"/><span class="chapnum">90</span>Accordingly, on the fourteenth of March he commended the government of the country to the senate, and granted to the restored exiles all the rest of the property confiscated by Nero which had not yet been sold for the imperial <a id="id_1fnm198"/>treasury.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn198" class="fnnum pginternal">198</a> The gift was a just one, and made a very good impression, but as a matter of fact it was nullified by the haste with which the work of collecting the money had been <a id="id_1fnm199"/>conducted.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn199" class="fnnum pginternal">199</a> He then summoned a public meeting, and, after extolling the majesty of Rome and praising the wholehearted adherence of the senate and people to his cause, he used very moderate language against the Vitellian party, criticizing the legions more for folly than treason, and making no mention of Vitellius himself. This may have been due to his own moderation, or it may be that the writer of the speech felt some qualms for his own safety, and therefore refrained from insulting Vitellius. For it was generally believed that as in strategy he took the advice of Suetonius Paulinus and Marius Celsus, so too in political matters he employed the talents of Galerius <a id="id_1fnm200"/>Trachalus.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-5.htm.html#id_1fn200" class="fnnum pginternal">200</a> Some <a id="id_1page109"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="109"></a>people even thought they could recognize Trachalus' style of oratory, fluent and sonorous, well adapted to tickle the ears of the crowd: and as he was a popular pleader his style was well known. The crowd's loud shouts of applause were in the best style of flattery, excessive and insincere. Men vied with each other in their enthusiasm and prayers for his success, much as though they were sending off the dictator Caesar or the emperor Augustus. Their motive was neither fear nor affection, but a sheer passion for servility. One can see the same in households of slaves, where each obeys his own interest and the common welfare counts for nothing. On his departure Otho entrusted the peace of the city and the interests of the empire to his brother Salvius Titianus.</p>
