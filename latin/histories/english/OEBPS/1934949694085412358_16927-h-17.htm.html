<body class="x-ebookmaker"><p><a id="IVchap78"/><span class="chapnum">78</span>All he said was true, and the other officers heaped the same reproaches on their heads. The men were drawn up in cohorts and companies, since it was impossible to deploy with the enemy swarming round them, and, the fight being inside the rampart, the tents and baggage were a serious encumbrance. Tutor and Classicus and Civilis, each at his post, were busy rallying their forces, appealing to the Gauls to fight for freedom, the Batavians for glory, and the Germans for plunder. Everything, indeed, went well for the enemy until the Twenty-first legion, who had rallied in a clearer space than any of the others, first sustained their charge and then repulsed them. Then, by divine providence, on the very point of victory the enemy suddenly lost their nerve and turned tail. They themselves attributed their panic to the appearance of the Roman auxiliaries, who, after being scattered by the first charge, formed again on the hill-tops and were taken for fresh reinforcements. However, what really cost the Gauls their victory was that they let their enemy alone and indulged in ignoble squabbles over the spoil. Thus after Cerialis' carelessness had <a id="id_2page193"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="193"></a>almost caused disaster, his pluck now saved the day, and he followed up his success by capturing the enemy's camp and destroying it before nightfall.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap79"/><span class="chapnum">79</span>Cerialis' troops were allowed short respite. Cologne was clamouring for help and offering to surrender Civilis' wife and sister and Classicus' daughter, who had been left behind there as pledges of the alliance. In the meantime the inhabitants had massacred all the stray Germans to be found in the town. They were now alarmed at this, and had good reason to implore aid before the enemy should recover their strength and bethink themselves of victory, or at any rate of revenge. Indeed, Civilis already had designs on Cologne, and he was still formidable, for the most warlike of his cohorts, composed of Chauci and <a id="id_2fnm443"/>Frisii,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn443" class="2fnnum pginternal">443</a> was still in full force at <a id="id_2fnm444"/>Tolbiacum,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn444" class="2fnnum pginternal">444</a> within the territory of Cologne. However, he changed his plans on receiving the bitter news that this force had been entrapped and destroyed by the inhabitants of Cologne. They had entertained them at a lavish banquet, drugged them with wine, shut the doors upon them and burned the place to the ground. At the same moment Cerialis came by forced marches to the relief of Cologne. A further anxiety haunted Civilis. He was afraid that the Fourteenth legion, in conjunction with the fleet from Britain,<a id="id_2fnm445"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn445" class="2fnnum pginternal">445</a> might harry <a id="id_2page194"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="194"></a>the Batavian coast. However, Fabius Priscus, who was in command, led his troops inland into the country of the Nervii and Tungri, who surrendered to him. The <a id="id_2fnm446"/>Canninefates<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn446" class="2fnnum pginternal">446</a> made an unprovoked attack upon the fleet and sank or captured the greater number of the ships. They also defeated a band of Nervian volunteers who had been recruited in the Roman interest. Classicus secured a further success against an advance-guard of cavalry which Cerialis had sent forward to Novaesium. These repeated checks, though unimportant in themselves, served to dim the lustre of the recent Roman <a id="id_2fnm447"/>victory.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn447" class="2fnnum pginternal">447</a></p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00056"><a id="Events"/>Events in Rome and in the East</h3>
<p><a id="IVchap80"/><span class="chapnum">80</span>It was about this time that Mucianus gave orders for the murder of Vitellius' <a id="id_2fnm448"/>son,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn448" class="2fnnum pginternal">448</a> on the plea that dissension would continue until all the seeds of war were stamped out. He also refused to allow Antonius Primus to go out on Domitian's staff, being alarmed at his popularity among the troops and at the man's own vanity, which would brook no equal, much less a superior. Antonius accordingly went to join Vespasian, whose reception, though not hostile, proved a disappointment. The emperor was drawn two ways. On the one side were Antonius' services: it was undeniable that his generalship had ended the war. In the other scale were Mucianus' letters. Besides <a id="id_2page195"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="195"></a>which, every one else seemed ready to rake up the scandals of his past life and inveigh against his vanity and bad temper. Antonius himself did his best to provoke hostility by expatiating to excess on his services, decrying the other generals as incompetent cowards, and stigmatizing Caecina as a prisoner who had surrendered. Thus without any open breach of friendship he gradually declined lower and lower in the emperor's favour.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap81"/><span class="chapnum">81</span>During the months which Vespasian spent at Alexandria waiting for the regular season of the summer <a id="id_2fnm449"/>winds<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn449" class="2fnnum pginternal">449</a> to ensure a safe voyage, there occurred many miraculous events manifesting the goodwill of Heaven and the special favour of Providence towards him. At Alexandria a poor workman who was well known to have a disease of the eye, acting on the advice of Serapis, whom this superstitious people worship as their chief god, fell at Vespasian's feet demanding with sobs a cure for his blindness, and imploring that the emperor would deign to moisten his eyes and eyeballs with the spittle from his mouth. Another man with a maimed hand, also inspired by Serapis, besought Vespasian to imprint his footmark on it. At first Vespasian laughed at them and refused. But they insisted. Half fearing to be thought a fool, half stirred to hopes by their petition and by the flattery of his courtiers, he eventually told the doctors to form an opinion whether such cases of blindness and deformity <a id="id_2page196"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="196"></a>could be remedied by human aid. The doctors talked round the question, saying that in the one case the power of sight was not extinct and would return, if certain impediments were removed; in the other case the limbs were distorted and could be set right again by the application of an effective remedy: this might be the will of Heaven and the emperor had perhaps been chosen as the divine instrument. They added that he would gain all the credit, if the cure were successful, while, if it failed, the ridicule would fall on the unfortunate patients. This convinced Vespasian that there were no limits to his destiny: nothing now seemed incredible. To the great excitement of the bystanders, he stepped forward with a smile on his face and did as the men desired him. Immediately the hand recovered its functions and daylight shone once more in the blind man's eyes. Those who were present still attest both miracles to-day,<a id="id_2fnm450"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn450" class="2fnnum pginternal">450</a> when there is nothing to gain by lying.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap82"/><span class="chapnum">82</span>This occurrence deepened Vespasian's desire to visit the holy-place and consult Serapis about the fortunes of the empire. He gave orders that no one else was to be allowed in the temple, and then went in. While absorbed in his devotions, he suddenly saw behind him an Egyptian noble, named Basilides, whom he knew to be lying ill several days' journey from Alexandria. He inquired of the priests whether Basilides had entered the temple that day. He inquired of every one he met whether he had been seen in the city. Even<a id="id_2page197"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="197"></a>tually he sent some horsemen, who discovered that at the time Basilides was eighty miles away. Vespasian therefore took what he had seen for a divine apparition, and guessed the meaning of the oracle from the name 'Basilides'.<a id="id_2fnm451"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn451" class="2fnnum pginternal">451</a></p>
<p><a id="IVchap83"/><span class="chapnum">83</span>The origins of the god Serapis are not given in any Roman authorities. The high-priests of Egypt give the following account: King Ptolemy, who was the first of the Macedonians to put the power of Egypt on a firm <a id="id_2fnm452"/>footing,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn452" class="2fnnum pginternal">452</a> was engaged in building walls and temples, and instituting religious cults for his newly founded city of Alexandria, when there appeared to him in his sleep a young man of striking beauty and supernatural stature, who warned him to send his most faithful friends to Pontus to fetch his image. After adding that this would bring luck to the kingdom, and that its resting-place would grow great and famous, he appeared to be taken up into heaven in a sheet of flame. Impressed by this miraculous prophecy, Ptolemy revealed his vision to the priests of Egypt, who are used to interpreting such things. As they had but little knowledge of Pontus or of foreign cults, he consulted an Athenian named Timotheus, a member of the Eumolpid <a id="id_2fnm453"/>clan,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn453" class="2fnnum pginternal">453</a> whom he had brought over from Eleusis to be overseer of <a id="id_2page198"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="198"></a>religious ceremonies, and asked him what worship and what god could possibly be meant. Timotheus found some people who had travelled in Pontus and learnt from them, that near a town called Sinope there was a temple, which had long been famous in the neighbourhood as the seat of Jupiter-Pluto,<a id="id_2fnm454"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn454" class="2fnnum pginternal">454</a> and near it there also stood a female figure, which was commonly called Proserpine. Ptolemy was like most despots, easily terrified at first, but liable, when his panic was over, to think more of his pleasures than of his religious duties. The incident was gradually forgotten, and other thoughts occupied his mind until the vision was repeated in a more terrible and impressive form than before, and he was threatened with death and the destruction of his kingdom if he failed to fulfil his instructions. He at once gave orders that representatives should be sent with presents to King Scydrothemis, who was then reigning at Sinope, and on their departure he instructed them to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphi. They made a successful voyage and received a clear answer from the oracle: they were to go and bring back the image of Apollo's father but leave his sister's behind.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap84"/><span class="chapnum">84</span>On their arrival at Sinope they laid their presents, their petition, and their king's instructions before Scydrothemis. He was in some perplexity. He was afraid of the god and yet alarmed by the threats of his subjects, who opposed the project: then, again, he often felt tempted by the envoys' presents and <a id="id_2page199"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="199"></a>promises. Three years passed. Ptolemy's zeal never abated for a moment. He persisted in his petition, and kept sending more and more distinguished envoys, more ships, more gold. Then a threatening vision appeared to Scydrothemis, bidding him no longer thwart the god's design. When he still hesitated, he was beset by every kind of disease and disaster: the gods were plainly angry and their hand was heavier upon him every day. He summoned an assembly and laid before it the divine commands, his own and Ptolemy's visions, and the troubles with which they were visited. The king found the people unfavourable. They were jealous of Egypt and fearful of their own future. So they surged angrily round the temple. The story now grows stranger still. The god himself, it says, embarked unaided on one of the ships that lay beached on the shore, and by a miracle accomplished the long sea-journey and landed at Alexandria within three days. A temple worthy of so important a city was then built in the quarter called Rhacotis, on the site of an ancient temple of Serapis and <a id="id_2fnm455"/>Isis.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn455" class="2fnnum pginternal">455</a> This is the most widely accepted account of the god's origin and arrival. Some people, I am well aware, maintain that the god was brought from the Syrian town of Seleucia during the <a id="id_2page200"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="200"></a>reign of Ptolemy, the third of that <a id="id_2fnm456"/>name.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn456" class="2fnnum pginternal">456</a> Others, again, say it was this same Ptolemy, but make the place of origin the famous town of Memphis,<a id="id_2fnm457"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn457" class="2fnnum pginternal">457</a> once the bulwark of ancient Egypt. Many take the god for Aesculapius, because he cures disease: others for Osiris, the oldest of the local gods; some, again, for Jupiter, as being the sovereign lord of the world. But the majority of people, either judging by what are clearly attributes of the god or by an ingenious process of conjecture, identify him with Pluto.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap85"/><span class="chapnum">85</span>Domitian and Mucianus were now on their way to the Alps.<a id="id_2fnm458"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn458" class="2fnnum pginternal">458</a> Before reaching the mountains they received the good news of the victory over the Treviri, the truth of which was fully attested by the presence of their leader Valentinus. His courage was in no way crushed and his face still bore witness to the proud spirit he had shown. He was allowed a hearing, merely to see what he was made of, and condemned to death. At his execution some one cast it in his teeth that his country was conquered, to which he replied, 'Then I am reconciled to death.'</p>
<p>Mucianus now gave utterance to an idea which he had long cherished, though he pretended it was a sudden inspiration. This was that, since by Heaven's grace the forces of the enemy had been broken, it would ill befit Domitian, now that the war was practically <a id="id_2page201"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="201"></a>over, to stand in the way of the other generals to whom the credit belonged. Were the fortunes of the empire or the safety of Gaul at stake, it would be right that a Caesar should take the field; the Canninefates and Batavi might be left to minor generals. So Domitian was to stay at Lugdunum and there show them the power and majesty of the throne at close quarters. By abstaining from trifling risks he would be ready to cope with any greater crisis.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap86"/><span class="chapnum">86</span>The ruse was detected, but it could not be unmasked. That was part of the courtier's <a id="id_2fnm459"/>policy.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-17.htm.html#id_2fn459" class="2fnnum pginternal">459</a> Thus they proceeded to Lugdunum. From there Domitian is supposed to have sent messengers to Cerialis to test his loyalty, and to ask whether the general would transfer his army and his allegiance to him, should he present himself in person. Whether Domitian's idea was to plan war against his father or to acquire support against his brother, cannot be decided, for Cerialis parried his proposal with a salutary snub and treated it as a boy's day-dream. Realizing that older men despised his youth, Domitian gave up even those functions of government which he had hitherto performed. Aping bashfulness and simple tastes, he hid his feelings under a cloak of impenetrable reserve, professing literary tastes and a passion for poetry. Thus he concealed his real self and withdrew from all rivalry with his brother, whose gentler and altogether different nature he perversely misconstrued.</p>

It seems to be suggested that the arrival of this statue from Pontus did not originate but invigorated the cult of Serapis. Pluto, Dis, Serapis, are all names for a god of the underworld. Jupiter seems added vaguely to give more power to the title. We cannot expect accurate theology from an amateur antiquarian.</p>

<p><a id="Vchap1"/><span class="chapnum">1</span>Early in this same <a id="id_2fnm460"/>year<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn460" class="2fnnum pginternal">460</a> Titus Caesar had been entrusted by his father with the task of completing the reduction of Judaea.<a id="id_2fnm461"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn461" class="2fnnum pginternal">461</a> While he and his father were both still private citizens, Titus had distinguished himself as a soldier, and his reputation for efficiency was steadily increasing, while the provinces and armies vied with one another in their enthusiasm for him. Wishing to seem independent of his good fortune, he always showed dignity and energy in the field. His affability called forth devotion. He constantly helped in the trenches and could mingle with his soldiers on the march without compromising his dignity as general. Three legions awaited him in Judaea, the Fifth, Tenth, and Fifteenth, all veterans from his father's army. These were reinforced by the Twelfth from Syria and by detachments of the Twenty-second and the <a id="id_2fnm462"/>Third,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn462" class="2fnnum pginternal">462</a> brought over from Alexandria. This force was accompanied by twenty auxiliary cohorts and eight regiments of auxiliary cavalry besides the Kings Agrippa and Sohaemus, King Antiochus' <a id="id_2fnm463"/>irregulars,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn463" class="2fnnum pginternal">463</a> a strong force of Arabs, who had a neighbourly hatred for the Jews, and a crowd of persons who had come from Rome and the rest of Italy, each tempted by the hope of securing <a id="id_2page203"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="203"></a>the first place in the prince's still unoccupied affections. With this force Titus entered the enemy's country at the head of his column, sending out scouts in all directions, and holding himself ready to fight. He pitched his camp not far from Jerusalem.</p>
<p><a id="Vchap2"/><span class="chapnum">2</span>Since I am coming now to describe the last days of this famous city, it may not seem out of place to recount here its early history. It is said that the Jews are refugees from <a id="id_2fnm464"/>Crete,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn464" class="2fnnum pginternal">464</a> who settled on the confines of Libya at the time when Saturn was forcibly deposed by Jupiter. The evidence for this is sought in the name. Ida is a famous mountain in Crete inhabited by the <a id="id_2fnm465"/>Idaei,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn465" class="2fnnum pginternal">465</a> whose name became lengthened into the foreign form Judaei. Others say that in the reign of Isis the superfluous population of Egypt, under the leadership of Hierosolymus and Juda, discharged itself upon the neighbouring districts, while there are many who think the Jews an Ethiopian stock, driven to migrate by their fear and dislike of King <a id="id_2fnm466"/>Cepheus.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn466" class="2fnnum pginternal">466</a> Another tradition makes them Assyrian refugees,<a id="id_2fnm467"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn467" class="2fnnum pginternal">467</a> who, <a id="id_2page204"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="204"></a>lacking lands of their own, occupied a district of Egypt, and later took to building cities of their own and tilling Hebrew territory and the frontier-land of Syria. Yet another version assigns to the Jews an illustrious origin as the descendants of the Solymi—a tribe famous in <a id="id_2fnm468"/>Homer<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn468" class="2fnnum pginternal">468</a>—who founded the city and called it Hiero<i>solyma</i> after their own <a id="id_2fnm469"/>name.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn469" class="2fnnum pginternal">469</a></p>
<p><a id="Vchap3"/><span class="chapnum">3</span>Most authorities agree that a foul and disfiguring disease once broke out in Egypt, and that King <a id="id_2fnm470"/>Bocchoris,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn470" class="2fnnum pginternal">470</a> on approaching the oracle of Ammon and inquiring for a remedy, was told to purge his kingdom of the plague and to transport all who suffered from it into some other country, for they had earned the disfavour of Heaven. A motley crowd was thus collected and abandoned in the desert. While all the other outcasts lay idly lamenting, one of them, named Moses, advised them not to look for help to gods or men, since both had deserted them, but to trust rather in themselves and accept as divine the guidance of the first being by whose aid they should get out of their present plight. They agreed, and set out blindly to march wherever chance might lead them.<a id="id_2page205"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="205"></a> Their worst distress came from lack of water. When they were already at death's door and lying prostrate all over the plain, it so happened that a drove of wild asses moved away from their pasture to a rock densely covered with trees. Guessing the truth from the grassy nature of the ground, Moses followed and disclosed an ample flow of <a id="id_2fnm471"/>water.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn471" class="2fnnum pginternal">471</a> This saved them. Continuing their march for six successive days, on the seventh they routed the natives and gained possession of the country. There they consecrated their city and their temple.</p>
<p><a id="Vchap4"/><span class="chapnum">4</span>To ensure his future hold over the people, Moses introduced a new cult, which was the opposite of all other religions. All that we hold sacred they held profane, and allowed practices which we abominate. They dedicated in a shrine an image of the <a id="id_2fnm472"/>animal<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn472" class="2fnnum pginternal">472</a> whose guidance had put an end to their wandering and thirst. They killed a ram, apparently as an insult to Ammon, and also sacrificed a bull, because the Egyptians worship the bull <a id="id_2fnm473"/>Apis.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn473" class="2fnnum pginternal">473</a> Pigs are subject to leprosy; so they abstain from pork in memory of their misfortune and the foul plague with which they were once infected.

They are said to have devoted the seventh day to rest, because that day brought an end to their troubles.<a id="id_2fnm475"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn475" class="2fnnum pginternal">475</a> Later, finding idleness alluring, they gave up the seventh year as well to <a id="id_2fnm476"/>sloth.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn476" class="2fnnum pginternal">476</a> Others maintain that they do this in honour of Saturn;<a id="id_2fnm477"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn477" class="2fnnum pginternal">477</a> either because their religious principles are derived from the Idaei, who are supposed to have been driven out with Saturn and become the ancestors of the Jewish people; or else because, of the seven constellations which govern the lives of men, the star of Saturn moves in the topmost orbit and exercises peculiar influence, and also because most of the heavenly bodies move <a id="id_2fnm478"/>round<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn478" class="2fnnum pginternal">478</a> their courses in multiples of seven.</p>
<p><a id="Vchap5"/><span class="chapnum">5</span>Whatever their origin, these rites are sanctioned by their antiquity. Their other customs are impious and abominable, and owe their prevalence to their depravity. For all the most worthless rascals, renouncing their national cults, were always sending money to swell the sum of offerings and <a id="id_2fnm479"/>tribute.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn479" class="2fnnum pginternal">479</a> This is one cause of Jewish prosperity. Another is that they <a id="id_2page207"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="207"></a>are obstinately loyal to each other, and always ready to show compassion, whereas they feel nothing but hatred and enmity for the rest of the <a id="id_2fnm480"/>world.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn480" class="2fnnum pginternal">480</a> They eat and sleep separately. Though immoderate in sexual indulgence, they refrain from all intercourse with foreign women: among themselves anything is <a id="id_2fnm481"/>allowed.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn481" class="2fnnum pginternal">481</a> They have introduced circumcision to distinguish themselves from other people. Those who are converted to their customs adopt the same practice, and the first lessons they learn are to despise the <a id="id_2fnm482"/>gods,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn482" class="2fnnum pginternal">482</a> to renounce their country, and to think nothing of their parents, children, and brethren. However, they take steps to increase their numbers. They count it a crime to kill any of their later-born <a id="id_2fnm483"/>children,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn483" class="2fnnum pginternal">483</a> and they believe that the souls of those who die in battle or under persecution are <a id="id_2fnm484"/>immortal.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn484" class="2fnnum pginternal">484</a> Thus they think <a id="id_2page208"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="208"></a>much of having children and nothing of facing death. They prefer to bury and not burn their <a id="id_2fnm485"/>dead.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn485" class="2fnnum pginternal">485</a> In this, as in their burial rites, and in their belief in an underworld, they conform to Egyptian custom. Their ideas of heaven are quite different. The Egyptians worship most of their gods as animals, or in shapes half animal and half human. The Jews acknowledge one god only, of whom they have a purely spiritual conception. They think it impious to make images of gods in human shape out of perishable materials. Their god is almighty and inimitable, without beginning and without end. They therefore set up no statues in their temples, nor even in their cities, refusing this homage both to their own kings and to the Roman emperors. However, the fact that their priests intoned to the flute and cymbals and wore wreaths of ivy, and that a golden vine was found in their <a id="id_2fnm486"/>temple<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn486" class="2fnnum pginternal">486</a> has led some people to think that they worship <a id="id_2fnm487"/>Bacchus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn487" class="2fnnum pginternal">487</a> who has so enthralled the East. But their cult would be most inappropriate. Bacchus instituted gay and cheerful rites, but the Jewish ritual is preposterous and morbid.</p>
<p><a id="id_2page209"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="209"></a><a id="Vchap6"/><span class="chapnum">6</span>The country of the Jews is bounded by Arabia on the east, by Egypt on the south, and on the west by Phoenicia and the sea. On the Syrian frontier they have a distant view towards the <a id="id_2fnm488"/>north.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn488" class="2fnnum pginternal">488</a> Physically they are healthy and hardy. Rain is rare; the soil infertile; its products are of the same kind as ours with the addition of balsam and palms. The palm is a tall and beautiful tree, the balsam a mere shrub. When its branches are swollen with sap they open them with a sharp piece of stone or crockery, for the sap-vessels shrink up at the touch of iron. The sap is used in medicine. Lebanon, their chief mountain, stands always deep in its eternal snow, a strange phenomenon in such a burning climate. Here, too, the river Jordan has its <a id="id_2fnm489"/>source<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn489" class="2fnnum pginternal">489</a> and comes pouring down, to find a home in the sea. It flows undiminished through first one lake, then another, and loses itself in a <a id="id_2fnm490"/>third.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn490" class="2fnnum pginternal">490</a> This last is a lake of immense size, like a sea, though its water has a foul taste and a most unhealthy smell, which poisons the surrounding inhabitants. No wind can stir waves in it: no fish or sea-birds can live there. The sluggish water supports whatever is thrown on to it, as if its surface were solid, while those who cannot swim float on it as easily as those who can. Every year at the same time the lake yields asphalt. As with other arts, it is experience which shows how to collect it. It is a black liquid which, when congealed with a <a id="id_2page210"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="210"></a>sprinkling of vinegar, floats on the surface of the water. The men who collect it take it in this state into their hands and haul it on deck. Then without further aid it trickles in and loads the boat until you cut off the stream. But this you cannot do with iron or brass: the current is turned by applying blood or a garment stained with a woman's menstrual discharge. That is what the old authorities say, but those who know the district aver that floating blocks of asphalt are driven landwards by the wind and dragged to shore by hand. The steam out of the earth and the heat of the sun dries them, and they are then split up with axes and wedges, like logs or blocks of stone.</p>
<p><a id="Vchap7"/><span class="chapnum">7</span>Not far from this lake are the Plains, which they say were once fertile and covered with large and populous cities which were destroyed by <a id="id_2fnm491"/>lightning.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn491" class="2fnnum pginternal">491</a> Traces of the cities are said to remain, and the ground, which looks scorched, has lost all power of production. The plants, whether wild or artificially cultivated, are blighted and sterile and wither into dust and ashes, either when in leaf or flower, or when they have attained their full growth. Without denying that at some date famous cities were there burnt up by lightning, I am yet inclined to think that it is the exhalation from the lake which infects the soil and poisons the surrounding atmosphere. Soil and climate being equally deleterious, the crops and fruits all rot away.</p>
<p><a id="id_2page211"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="211"></a>The river Belus also falls into this Jewish sea. Round its mouth is found a peculiar kind of sand which is mixed with native soda and smelted into glass. Small though the beach is, its product is inexhaustible.</p>
<p><a id="Vchap8"/><span class="chapnum">8</span>The greater part of the population live in scattered villages, but they also have towns. Jerusalem is the Jewish capital, and contained the temple, which was enormously wealthy. A first line of fortifications guarded the city, another the palace, and an innermost line enclosed the <a id="id_2fnm492"/>temple.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn492" class="2fnnum pginternal">492</a> None but a Jew was allowed as far as the doors: none but the priests might cross the threshold.<a id="id_2fnm493"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn493" class="2fnnum pginternal">493</a> When the East was in the hands of the Assyrians, Medes and Persians, they regarded the Jews as the meanest of their slaves. During the Macedonian <a id="id_2fnm494"/>ascendancy<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn494" class="2fnnum pginternal">494</a> King <a id="id_2fnm495"/>Antiochus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn495" class="2fnnum pginternal">495</a> endeavoured to abolish their superstitions and to introduce Greek manners and customs. But Arsaces at that moment <a id="id_2fnm496"/>rebelled,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn496" class="2fnnum pginternal">496</a> and the Parthian war prevented him from effecting any improvement in the character of this grim people. Then, when Macedon waned, as the Parthian power was not yet ripe and Rome was <a id="id_2page212"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="212"></a>still far away, they took kings of their <a id="id_2fnm497"/>own.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn497" class="2fnnum pginternal">497</a> The mob were fickle and drove them out. However, they recovered their throne by force; banished their countrymen, sacked cities, slew their brothers, wives, and parents, and committed all the usual kingly crimes. But this only fostered the hold of the Jewish religion, since the kings had strengthened their authority by assuming the priesthood.</p>
<p><a id="Vchap9"/><span class="chapnum">9</span>Cnaeus Pompeius was the first Roman to subdue the Jews and set foot in their temple by right of <a id="id_2fnm498"/>conquest.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn498" class="2fnnum pginternal">498</a> It was then first realized that the temple contained no image of any god: their sanctuary was empty, their mysteries meaningless. The walls of Jerusalem were destroyed, but the temple was left standing. Later, during the Roman civil wars, when the eastern provinces had come under the control of Mark Antony, the Parthian Prince Pacorus seized Judaea,<a id="id_2fnm499"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn499" class="2fnnum pginternal">499</a> and was killed by Publius Ventidius. The Parthians were driven back over the Euphrates, and Caius <a id="id_2fnm500"/>Sosius<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn500" class="2fnnum pginternal">500</a> subdued the Jews. Antony gave the kingdom to <a id="id_2fnm501"/>Herod,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn501" class="2fnnum pginternal">501</a> and Augustus, after his victory, enlarged it. After Herod's death, somebody called<a id="id_2page213"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="213"></a> Simon,<a id="id_2fnm502"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn502" class="2fnnum pginternal">502</a> without awaiting the emperor's decision, forcibly assumed the title of king. He was executed by Quintilius Varus, who was Governor of Syria; the Jews were repressed and the kingdom divided between three of Herod's <a id="id_2fnm503"/>sons.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn503" class="2fnnum pginternal">503</a> Under Tiberius all was quiet. Caligula ordered them to put up his statue in the temple. They preferred war to that. But Caligula's death put an end to the rising.<a id="id_2fnm504"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn504" class="2fnnum pginternal">504</a> In Claudius' reign the kings had all either died or lost most of their territory. The emperor therefore made Judaea a province to be governed by Roman knights or freedmen. One of these, Antonius <a id="id_2fnm505"/>Felix,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn505" class="2fnnum pginternal">505</a> indulged in every kind of cruelty and immorality, wielding a king's authority with all the instincts of a slave. He had married Drusilla, a granddaughter of Antony and Cleopatra, so that he was Antony's grandson-in-law, while Claudius was Antony's <a id="id_2fnm506"/>grandson.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn506" class="2fnnum pginternal">506</a></p>
<p><a id="Vchap10"/><span class="chapnum">10</span>The Jews endured such oppression patiently until the time of Gessius <a id="id_2fnm507"/>Florus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn507" class="2fnnum pginternal">507</a> under whom war broke out. Cestius Gallus, the Governor of Syria, tried to crush it, but met with more reverses than victories. He died, either in the natural course or perhaps of disgust, and Nero sent out Vespasian, who, in a couple of campaigns,<a id="id_2fnm508"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn508" class="2fnnum pginternal">508</a> thanks to his reputation, good fortune, and able subordinates, had the whole of the country <a id="id_2page214"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="214"></a>districts and all the towns except Jerusalem under the heel of his victorious army. The next <a id="id_2fnm509"/>year<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn509" class="2fnnum pginternal">509</a> was taken up with civil war, and passed quietly enough as far as the Jews were concerned. But peace once restored in Italy, foreign troubles began again with feelings embittered on our side by the thought that the Jews were the only people who had not given in. At the same time it seemed best to leave Titus at the head of the army to meet the eventualities of the new reign, whether good or bad.</p>
<p><a id="Vchap11"/><span class="chapnum">11</span>Thus, as we have already <a id="id_2fnm510"/>seen,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn510" class="2fnnum pginternal">510</a> Titus pitched his camp before the walls of Jerusalem and proceeded to display his legions in battle order. The Jews formed up at the foot of their own walls, ready, if successful, to venture further, but assured of their retreat in case of reverse. A body of cavalry and some light-armed foot were sent forward, and fought an indecisive engagement, from which the enemy eventually retired. During the next few days a series of skirmishes took place in front of the gates, and at last continual losses drove the Jews behind their walls. The Romans then determined to take it by storm. It seemed undignified to sit and wait for the enemy to starve, and the men all clamoured for the risks, some being really brave, while many others were wild and greedy for plunder. Titus himself had the vision of Rome with all her wealth and pleasures before his eyes, and felt that their enjoyment was postponed unless Jerusalem fell at once. The city, however, stands high and is <a id="id_2page215"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="215"></a>fortified with works strong enough to protect a city standing on the plain. Two enormous <a id="id_2fnm511"/>hills<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn511" class="2fnnum pginternal">511</a> were surrounded by walls ingeniously built so as to project or slope inwards and thus leave the flanks of an attacking party exposed to fire. The rocks were jagged at the top. The towers, where the rising ground helped, were sixty feet high, and in the hollows as much as a hundred and twenty. They are a wonderful sight and seem from a distance to be all of equal height. Within this runs another line of fortification surrounding the palace, and on a conspicuous height stands the Antonia, a castle named by Herod in honour of Mark Antony.</p>
<p><a id="Vchap12"/><span class="chapnum">12</span>The temple was built like a citadel with walls of its own, on which more care and labour had been spent than on any of the others. Even the cloisters surrounding the temple formed a splendid rampart. There was a never-failing spring of <a id="id_2fnm512"/>water,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn512" class="2fnnum pginternal">512</a> catacombs hollowed out of the hills, and pools or cisterns for holding the rain-water. Its original builders had foreseen that the peculiarities of Jewish life would lead to frequent wars, consequently everything was ready for the longest of sieges. Besides this, when Pompey took the city, bitter experience taught them <a id="id_2page216"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="216"></a>several lessons, and in the days of Claudius they had taken advantage of his avarice to buy rights of fortification, and built walls in peace-time as though war were imminent. Their numbers were now swelled by floods of human refuse and unfortunate refugees from other <a id="id_2fnm513"/>towns.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn513" class="2fnnum pginternal">513</a> All the most desperate characters in the country had taken refuge there, which did not conduce to unity. They had three armies, each with its own general. The outermost and largest line of wall was held by Simon; the central city by John, and the temple by <a id="id_2fnm514"/>Eleazar.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn514" class="2fnnum pginternal">514</a> John and Simon were stronger than Eleazar in numbers and equipment, but he had the advantage of a strong position. Their relations mainly consisted of fighting, treachery, and arson: a large quantity of corn was burnt. Eventually, under pretext of offering a sacrifice, John sent a party of men to massacre Eleazar and his troops, and by this means gained possession of the <a id="id_2fnm515"/>temple.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn515" class="2fnnum pginternal">515</a> Thus Jerusalem was divided into two hostile parties, but on the approach of the Romans the necessities of foreign warfare reconciled their differences.</p>
<p><a id="Vchap13"/><span class="chapnum">13</span>Various portents had occurred at this time, but so sunk in superstition are the Jews and so opposed to all religious practices that they think it wicked <a id="id_2page217"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="217"></a>to avert the threatened evil by <a id="id_2fnm516"/>sacrifices<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn516" class="2fnnum pginternal">516</a> or vows. Embattled armies were seen to meet in the sky with flashing arms, and the temple shone with sudden fire from heaven. The doors of the shrine suddenly opened, a supernatural voice was heard calling the gods out, and at once there began a mighty movement of departure. Few took alarm at all this. Most people held the belief that, according to the ancient priestly writings, this was the moment at which the East was fated to prevail: they would now start forth from Judaea and conquer the world.<a id="id_2fnm517"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-18.htm.html#id_2fn517" class="2fnnum pginternal">517</a> This enigmatic prophecy really applied to Vespasian and Titus. But men are blinded by their hopes. The Jews took to themselves the promised destiny, and even defeat could not convince them of the truth. The number of the besieged, men and women of every age, is stated to have reached six hundred thousand. There were arms for all who could carry them, and far more were ready to fight than would be expected from their total numbers. The women were as determined as the men: if they were forced to leave their homes they had more to fear in life than in death.</p>
<p>Such was the city and such the people with which<a id="id_2page218"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="218"></a> Titus was faced. As the nature of the ground forbade a sudden assault, he determined to employ siege-works and penthouse shelters. The work was accordingly divided among the legions, and there was a truce to fighting until they had got ready every means of storming a town that had ever been devised by experience or inventive ingenuity.</p>
