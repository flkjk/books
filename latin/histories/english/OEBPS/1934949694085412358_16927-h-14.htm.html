<h3 id="pgepubid00049"><a id="The_Revolt"/>The Revolt of Civilis and the Batavi</h3>
<p><a id="IVchap12"/><span class="chapnum">12</span>The growing rumour of a reverse in <a id="id_2fnm264"/>Germany<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn264" class="2fnnum pginternal">264</a> had not as yet caused any alarm in Rome. People alluded to the loss of armies, the capture of the legions' winter quarters, the defection of the Gallic provinces as matters of indifference. I must now go back and explain the origin of this war, and of the widespread rebellion of foreign and allied tribes which now broke into flame.</p>
<p>The Batavi were once a tribe of the <a id="id_2fnm265"/>Chatti,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn265" class="2fnnum pginternal">265</a> living on the further bank of the Rhine. But an outbreak of civil war had driven them across the river, where they settled in a still unoccupied district on the frontier of Gaul and also in the neighbouring island, enclosed on one side by the ocean and on the other three sides by the <a id="id_2fnm266"/>Rhine.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn266" class="2fnnum pginternal">266</a> There they fared better than most tribes who ally themselves to a stronger power. Their resources are still intact, and they have only to contribute men and arms for the imperial <a id="id_2fnm267"/>army.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn267" class="2fnnum pginternal">267</a> After <a id="id_2page112"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="112"></a>a long training in the German wars, they still further increased their reputation in Britain, where their troops had been sent, commanded according to an ancient custom by some of the noblest chiefs. There still remained behind in their own country a picked troop of horsemen with a peculiar knack of swimming, which enabled them to make a <a id="id_2fnm268"/>practice<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn268" class="2fnnum pginternal">268</a> of crossing the Rhine with unbroken ranks without losing control of their horses or their weapons.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap13"/><span class="chapnum">13</span>Of their chieftains two outshone the rest. These were Julius Paulus and Julius Civilis, both of royal stock. Paulus had been executed by Fonteius Capito on a false charge of rebellion.<a id="id_2fnm269"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn269" class="2fnnum pginternal">269</a> On the same occasion Civilis was sent in chains to Nero. Galba, however, set him free, and under Vitellius he again ran great risk of his life, when the army clamoured for his execution.<a id="id_2fnm270"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn270" class="2fnnum pginternal">270</a> This gave him a motive for hating Rome, and our misfortunes fed his hopes. He was, indeed, far cleverer than most barbarians, and professed to be a second Sertorius or Hannibal, because they all three had the same physical <a id="id_2fnm271"/>defect.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn271" class="2fnnum pginternal">271</a> He was afraid that if he openly rebelled against the Roman people they would treat him as an enemy, and march on him at once, so he pretended to be a keen supporter of Vespasian's party. This much was true, that Antonius<a id="id_2page113"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="113"></a> Primus had written instructing him to divert the auxiliaries whom Vitellius had summoned, and to delay the legions on the pretence of a rising in Germany. Moreover, Hordeonius <a id="id_2fnm272"/>Flaccus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn272" class="2fnnum pginternal">272</a> had given him the same advice in person, for Flaccus was inclined to support Vespasian and anxious for the safety of Rome, which was threatened with utter disaster, if the war were to break out afresh and all these thousands of troops come pouring into Italy.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap14"/><span class="chapnum">14</span>Having thus made up his mind to rebel, Civilis concealed in the meantime his ulterior design, and while intending to guide his ultimate policy by future events, proceeded to initiate the rising as follows. The young Batavians were by Vitellius' orders being pressed for service, and this burden was being rendered even more irksome than it need have been by the greed and depravity of the recruiting officers. They took to enrolling elderly men and invalids so as to get bribes for excusing them: or, as most of the Batavi are tall and good-looking in their youth, they would seize the handsomest boys for immoral purposes. This caused bad feeling; an agitation was organized, and they were persuaded to refuse service. Accordingly, on the pretext of giving a banquet, Civilis summoned the chief nobles and the most determined of the tribesmen to a sacred grove. Then, when he saw them excited by their revelry and the late hour of the night, he began to speak of the glorious past of the Batavi and to enumerate the wrongs they had suffered, the injustice <a id="id_2page114"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="114"></a>and extortion and all the evils of their slavery. 'We are no longer treated,' he said, 'as we used to be, like allies, but like menials and slaves. Why, we are never even visited by an imperial <a id="id_2fnm273"/>Governor<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn273" class="2fnnum pginternal">273</a>—irksome though the insolence of his staff would be. We are given over to prefects and centurions; and when these subordinates have had their fill of extortion and of bloodshed, they promptly find some one to replace them, and then there are new pockets to fill and new pretexts for plunder. Now conscription is upon us: children are to be torn from parents, brother from brother, never, probably, to meet again. And yet the fortunes of Rome were never more depressed. Their cantonments contain nothing but loot and a lot of old men. Lift up your eyes and look at them. There is nothing to fear from legions that only exist on <a id="id_2fnm274"/>paper.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn274" class="2fnnum pginternal">274</a> And we are strong. We have infantry and cavalry: the Germans are our kinsmen: the Gauls share our ambition. Even the Romans will be grateful if we go to <a id="id_2fnm275"/>war.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn275" class="2fnnum pginternal">275</a> If we fail, we can claim credit for supporting Vespasian: if we succeed, there will be no one to call us to account.'</p>
<p><a id="IVchap15"/><span class="chapnum">15</span>His speech was received with great approval, and he at once bound them all to union, using the barbarous ceremonies and strange oaths of his country. They <a id="id_2page115"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="115"></a>then sent to the Canninefates to join their enterprise. This tribe inhabits part of the <a id="id_2fnm276"/>Island,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn276" class="2fnnum pginternal">276</a> and though inferior in numbers to the Batavi, they are of the same race and language and the same courageous spirit. Civilis next sent secret messages to win over the Batavian troops, which after serving as Roman auxiliaries in Britain had been sent, as we have already seen,<a id="id_2fnm277"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn277" class="2fnnum pginternal">277</a> to Germany and were now stationed at <a id="id_2fnm278"/>Mainz.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn278" class="2fnnum pginternal">278</a></p>
<p>One of the Canninefates, Brinno by name, was a man of distinguished family and stubborn courage. His father had often ventured acts of hostility, and had with complete impunity shown his contempt for Caligula's farcical <a id="id_2fnm279"/>expedition.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn279" class="2fnnum pginternal">279</a> To belong to such a family of rebels was in itself a recommendation. He was accordingly placed on a shield, swung up on the shoulders of his friends, and thus elected leader after the fashion of the tribe. Summoning to his aid the <a id="id_2fnm280"/>Frisii<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn280" class="2fnnum pginternal">280</a>—a tribe from beyond the Rhine—he fell upon two cohorts of auxiliaries whose camp lay close to the neighbouring <a id="id_2fnm281"/>shore.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn281" class="2fnnum pginternal">281</a> The attack was unexpected, and the troops, even if they had foreseen it, were not strong enough to offer resistance: so the camp was taken and looted. They then fell on the Roman camp-<a id="id_2page116"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="116"></a>followers and traders, who had gone off in all directions as if peace were assured. Finding the forts now threatened with destruction, the Roman officers set fire to them, as they had no means of defence. All the troops with their standards and colours retired in a body to the upper end of the island, led by Aquilius, a senior centurion. But they were an army in name only, not in strength, for Vitellius had withdrawn all the efficient soldiers and had replaced them by a useless mob, who had been drawn from the neighbouring Nervian and German villages and were only embarrassed by their <a id="id_2fnm282"/>armour.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn282" class="2fnnum pginternal">282</a></p>
<p><a id="IVchap16"/><span class="chapnum">16</span>Civilis thought it best to proceed by guile, and actually ventured to blame the Roman officers for abandoning the forts. He could, he told them, with the cohort under his command, suppress the outbreak of the Canninefates without their assistance: they could all go back to their winter-quarters. However, it was plain that some treachery underlay his advice—it would be easier to crush the cohorts if they were separated—and also that Civilis, not Brinno, was at the head of this war. Evidence of this gradually leaked out, as the Germans loved war too well to keep <a id="id_2page117"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="117"></a>the secret for long. Finding his artifice unsuccessful, Civilis tried force instead, forming the Canninefates, Frisii and Batavi into three separate columns.<a id="id_2fnm283"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn283" class="2fnnum pginternal">283</a> The Roman line faced them in position near the Rhine bank.<a id="id_2fnm284"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn284" class="2fnnum pginternal">284</a> They had brought their ships there after the burning of the forts, and these were now turned with their prows towards the enemy. Soon after the engagement began a Tungrian cohort deserted to Civilis, and the Romans were so startled by this unexpected treachery that they were cut to pieces by their allies and their enemies combined. Similar treachery occurred in the fleet. Some of the rowers, who were Batavians, feigning clumsiness tried to impede the sailors and marines in the performance of their functions, and after a while openly resisted them and turned the ships' sterns towards the enemy's bank. Finally, they killed the pilots and centurions who refused to join them, and thus all the twenty-four ships of the flotilla either deserted to the enemy or were captured by them.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap17"/><span class="chapnum">17</span>This victory made Civilis immediately famous and proved subsequently very useful. Having now got the ships and the weapons which they needed, he and his <a id="id_2page118"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="118"></a>followers were enthusiastically proclaimed as champions of liberty throughout Germany and Gaul. The German provinces immediately sent envoys with offers of help, while Civilis endeavoured by diplomacy and by bribery to secure an alliance with the Gauls. He sent back the auxiliary officers whom he had taken prisoner, each to his own tribe, and offered the cohorts the choice of either going home or remaining with him. Those who remained were given an honourable position in his army: and those who went home received presents out of the Roman spoil. At the same time Civilis talked to them confidentially and reminded them of the miseries they had endured for all these years, in which they had disguised their wretched slavery under the name of peace. 'The Batavi,' he would say, 'were excused from taxation, and yet they have taken arms against the common tyrant. In the first engagement the Romans were routed and beaten. What if Gaul throws off the yoke? What forces are there left in Italy? It is with the blood of provincials that their provinces are won. Don't think of the defeat of . Why, it was the Batavian cavalry which trampled on the Aedui and <a id="id_2fnm285"/>Arverni,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn285" class="2fnnum pginternal">285</a> and there were Belgic auxiliaries in Verginius' force. The truth is that Gaul succumbed to her own armies. But now we are all united in one party, fortified, moreover, by the military discipline which prevails in Roman camps:<a id="id_2page119"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="119"></a> and we have on our side the veterans before whom Otho's legions lately bit the dust. Let Syria and Asia play the slave: the East is used to tyrants: but there are many still living in Gaul who were born before the days of <a id="id_2fnm286"/>tribute.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn286" class="2fnnum pginternal">286</a> Indeed, it is only the other <a id="id_2fnm287"/>day<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn287" class="2fnnum pginternal">287</a> that Quintilius Varus was killed, when slavery was driven out of Germany, and they brought into the field not the Emperor Vitellius but Caesar Augustus himself. Why, liberty is the natural prerogative even of dumb animals: courage is the peculiar attribute of man. Heaven helps the brave. Come, then, fall upon them while your hands are free and theirs are tied, while you are fresh and they are weary. Some of them are for Vespasian, others for Vitellius; now is your chance to crush both parties at once.'</p>
<p><a id="IVchap18"/><span class="chapnum">18</span>Civilis thus had his eye on Gaul and Germany and aspired, had his project prospered, to become king of two countries, one pre-eminent in wealth and the other in military strength.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00050"><a id="The_Mutiny"/>The Mutiny of the Batavian Cohorts</h3>
<p>Hordeonius Flaccus at first furthered Civilis' schemes by shutting his eyes to them. But when messengers kept arriving in panic with news that a camp had been stormed, cohorts wiped out, and not a Roman left in the Batavian Island, he instructed<a id="id_2page120"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="120"></a> Munius Lupercus, who commanded the two <a id="id_2fnm288"/>legions<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn288" class="2fnnum pginternal">288</a> in winter-quarters,<a id="id_2fnm289"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn289" class="2fnnum pginternal">289</a> to march against the enemy. Lupercus lost no time in crossing the <a id="id_2fnm290"/>river,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn290" class="2fnnum pginternal">290</a> taking the legions whom he had with him, some <a id="id_2fnm291"/>Ubii<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn291" class="2fnnum pginternal">291</a> who were close at hand, and the Treviran cavalry who were stationed not far away. To this force he added a regiment of Batavian cavalry, who, though their loyalty had long ago succumbed, still concealed the fact, because they hoped their desertion would fetch a higher price, if they actually betrayed the Romans on the field. Civilis set the standards of the defeated <a id="id_2fnm292"/>cohorts<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn292" class="2fnnum pginternal">292</a> round him in a ring to keep their fresh honours before the eyes of his men, and to terrify the enemy by reminding them of their disaster. He also gave orders that his own mother and sisters and all the wives and small children of his soldiers should be stationed in the rear to spur them to victory or shame them if they were <a id="id_2fnm293"/>beaten.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn293" class="2fnnum pginternal">293</a> When his line raised their battle-cry, the men singing and the women shrieking, the legions and their auxiliaries replied with a comparatively feeble cheer, for their left wing had been exposed by the desertion of the Batavian cavalry, who promptly turned against us. However, despite the confusion, the <a id="id_2page121"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="121"></a>legionaries gripped their swords and kept their places. Then the Ubian and Treviran auxiliaries broke in shameful flight and went wandering all over the country. The Germans pressed hard on their heels and meanwhile the legions could make good their escape into the camp, which was called 'Castra Vetera'.<a id="id_2fnm294"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn294" class="2fnnum pginternal">294</a> Claudius Labeo, who commanded the Batavian cavalry, had opposed Civilis as a rival in some petty municipal dispute. Civilis was afraid that, if he killed him, he might offend his countrymen, while if he spared him his presence would give rise to dissension; so he sent him off by sea to the Frisii.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap19"/><span class="chapnum">19</span>It was at this time that the cohorts of Batavians and Canninefates, on their way to Rome under orders from Vitellius, received the message which Civilis had sent to <a id="id_2fnm295"/>them.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn295" class="2fnnum pginternal">295</a> They promptly fell into a ferment of unruly insolence and demanded a special grant as payment for their journey, double pay, and an increase in the number of their <a id="id_2fnm296"/>cavalry.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn296" class="2fnnum pginternal">296</a> Although all these things had been promised by Vitellius they had no hope of obtaining them, but wanted an excuse for rebellion. Flaccus made many concessions, but the only result was that they redoubled their vigour and demanded what they felt sure he would refuse. Paying no further heed to him they made for Lower Germany, <a id="id_2page122"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="122"></a>to join Civilis. Flaccus summoned the tribunes and centurions and debated with them whether he should use force to punish this defiance of authority. After a while he gave way to his natural cowardice and the fears of his subordinates, who were distressed by the thought that the loyalty of the auxiliaries was doubtful and that the legions had been recruited by a hurried levy. It was decided, therefore, to keep the soldiers in <a id="id_2fnm297"/>camp.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn297" class="2fnnum pginternal">297</a> However, he soon changed his mind when he found himself criticized by the very men whose advice he had taken. He now seemed bent on pursuit, and wrote to Herennius Gallus in command of the First legion, who was holding Bonn, telling him to bar the path of the Batavians, and promising that he and his army would follow hard upon their heels. The rebels might certainly have been crushed had Flaccus and Gallus each advanced their forces from opposite directions and thus surrounded them. But Flaccus soon gave up the idea, and wrote another letter to Gallus, warning him to let the rebels pass undisturbed. This gave rise to a suspicion that the generals were purposely promoting the war; and all the disasters which had already occurred or were feared in the future, were attributed not to the soldiers' inefficiency or the strength of the enemy, but to the treachery of the generals.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap20"/><span class="chapnum">20</span>On nearing the camp at Bonn, the Batavians sent forward a messenger to explain their intentions to Herennius Gallus. Against the Romans, for whom <a id="id_2page123"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="123"></a>they had fought so often, they had no wish to make war: but they were worn out after a long and unprofitable term of service and wanted to go home and rest. If no one opposed them they would march peaceably by; but if hostility was offered they would find a passage at the point of the sword. Gallus hesitated, but his men induced him to risk an engagement. Three thousand legionaries, some hastily recruited Belgic auxiliaries, and a mob of peasants and camp-followers, who were as cowardly in action as they were boastful before it, came pouring out simultaneously from all the gates, hoping with their superior numbers to surround the Batavians. But these were experienced veterans. They formed up into <a id="id_2fnm298"/>columns<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-14.htm.html#id_2fn298" class="2fnnum pginternal">298</a> in deep formation that defied assault on front, flank, or rear. They thus pierced our thinner line. The Belgae giving way, the legion was driven back and ran in terror to reach the trench and the gates of the camp. It was there that we suffered the heaviest losses. The trenches were filled with dead, who were not all killed by the blows of the enemy, for many were stifled in the press or perished on each other's swords. The victorious cohorts avoided Cologne and marched on without attempting any further hostilities. For the battle at Bonn they continued to excuse themselves. They had asked for peace, they said, and when peace was persistently refused, had merely acted in self-defence.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00051"><a id="The_Siege"/>The Siege of Vetera</h3>
<p><a id="IVchap21"/><span class="chapnum">21</span>After the arrival of these veteran cohorts Civilis was now at the head of a respectable army. But being still uncertain of his plans, and engaged in reckoning up the Roman forces, he made all who were with him swear allegiance to Vespasian, and sent envoys to the two legions, who after their defeat in the former <a id="id_2fnm299"/>engagement<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn299" class="2fnnum pginternal">299</a> had retired into Vetera, asking them to take the same oath. The answer came back that they never followed the advice either of a traitor or of an enemy: Vitellius was their emperor, and they would keep their allegiance and their arms for him so long as they had breath in their bodies. A Batavian deserter need not try to decide the destiny of Rome; he should rather expect the punishment he richly deserved. When this was reported to Civilis he flew into a passion, and called the whole Batavian people to take arms. They were joined by the Bructeri and <a id="id_2fnm300"/>Tencteri,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn300" class="2fnnum pginternal">300</a> and Germany was summoned to come and share the plunder and the glory.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap22"/><span class="chapnum">22</span>Threatened with this gathering storm, Munius Lupercus and Numisius Rufus, who were in command of the two legions, proceeded to strengthen the ramparts and walls. They pulled down the buildings near the military camp, which had grown into a small town during the long years of peace, fearing that the <a id="id_2page125"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="125"></a>enemy might make use of them. But they omitted to provide a sufficient store of provisions for the camp, and authorized the soldiers to make up the deficiency by looting, with the result that what might have supplied their needs for a long time was consumed in a few days. Meanwhile Civilis advanced, himself holding the centre with the flower of the Batavi: on both banks of the Rhine he massed large bands of Germans to strike terror into the enemy: the cavalry galloped through the fields, while the ships were simultaneously moved up the stream. Here could be seen the colours of veteran Roman cohorts, there the figures of beasts which the Germans had brought from their woods and groves, as their tribes do when they go to battle. It seemed both a civil and a savage war at once; and this strange confusion astounded the besieged. The hopes of the assailants rose when they saw the circumference of the ramparts, for there were barely five thousand Roman soldiers to defend a camp which had been laid out to hold two legions.<a id="id_2fnm301"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn301" class="2fnnum pginternal">301</a> However, a large number of camp-followers had collected there on the break-up of peace, and remained to give what assistance they could to the military operations.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap23"/><span class="chapnum">23</span>The camp was built partly on the gentle slope of a hill and partly on the level ground. Augustus had believed that it would serve as a base of operations and a check upon the German tribes: as for their actually coming to assault our legions, such a disaster <a id="id_2page126"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="126"></a>never occurred to him. Consequently no trouble had been taken in choosing the site or erecting defences: the strength of the troops had always seemed sufficient.</p>
<p>The Batavians and the Germans from across the <a id="id_2fnm302"/>Rhine<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn302" class="2fnnum pginternal">302</a> now formed up tribe by tribe—the separation was designed to show their individual prowess—and opened fire from a distance. Finding that most of their missiles fell harmlessly on to the turrets and pinnacles of the walls, and that they were being wounded by stones hurled from above, they charged with a wild shout and surged up to the rampart, some using scaling-ladders, others climbing over their comrades who had formed a 'tortoise'. But no sooner had some of them begun to scale the wall, than they were hurled down by the besieged, who thrust at them with sword and shield, and buried under a shower of stakes and javelins. The Germans are always impetuous at the beginning of an action and over-confident when they are winning; and on this occasion their greed for plunder even steeled them to face difficulties. They actually attempted to use siege-engines, with which they were quite unfamiliar. But though they had no skill themselves, some of the deserters and prisoners showed them how to build a sort of bridge or platform of timber, on to which they fitted wheels and rolled it forward. Thus some of them stood on this platform and fought as though from a mound, while others, concealed inside, tried to undermine the walls. However, stones hurled from catapults soon <a id="id_2page127"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="127"></a>destroyed this rude engine. Then they began to get ready hurdles and mantlets, but the besieged shot blazing spears on to them from engines, and even attacked the assailants themselves with fire-darts. At last they gave up all hope of an assault and resolved to try a waiting policy, being well aware that the camp contained only a few days' provisions and a large number of non-combatants. They hoped that famine would breed treason, and counted, besides, on the wavering loyalty of the slaves and the usual hazards of war to aid them.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap24"/><span class="chapnum">24</span>Meanwhile, <a id="id_2fnm303"/>Flaccus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn303" class="2fnnum pginternal">303</a> who had received news of the siege of Vetera, dispatched a party to recruit auxiliaries in Gaul, and gave Dillius Vocula, in command of the Twenty-second, a force of picked soldiers from his two <a id="id_2fnm304"/>legions.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn304" class="2fnnum pginternal">304</a> Vocula was to hurry by forced marches along the bank of the Rhine, while Flaccus himself was to approach by water, since he was in bad health and unpopular with his men. Indeed, they grumbled openly that he had let the Batavian cohorts get away from Mainz, had connived at Civilis' schemes, and invited the Germans to join the alliance. Vespasian, they said, owed his rise more to Flaccus than to all the assistance of Antonius Primus or of Mucianus, for overt hatred and hostility can be openly crushed, but treachery and deceit cannot be detected, much less parried. While Civilis took the field himself and arranged his own fighting line, Hordeonius lay on a couch in his bedroom and gave whatever orders <a id="id_2page128"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="128"></a>best suited the enemy's convenience. Why should all these companies of brave soldiers be commanded by one miserable old invalid? Let them rather kill the traitor and free their brave hearts and good hopes from the incubus of such an evil omen. Having worked on each other's feelings by these complaints, they were still further incensed by the arrival of a letter from Vespasian. As this could not be concealed, Flaccus read it before a meeting of the soldiers, and the messengers who brought it were sent to Vitellius in chains.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap25"/><span class="chapnum">25</span>With feelings thus appeased the army marched on to Bonn, the head-quarters of the First legion. There the men were still more indignant with Flaccus, on whom they laid the blame of their recent defeat.<a id="id_2fnm305"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn305" class="2fnnum pginternal">305</a> It was by his orders, they argued, that they had taken the field against the Batavians on the understanding that the legions from Mainz were in pursuit. But no reinforcements had arrived and his treachery was responsible for their losses. The facts, moreover, were unknown to the other armies, nor was any report sent to their emperor, although this treacherous outbreak could have been nipped in the bud by the combined aid of all the provinces. In answer Flaccus read out to the army copies of all the letters which he had sent from time to time all over Gaul and Britain and Spain to ask for assistance, and introduced the disastrous practice of having all letters delivered to the standard-bearers of the legions, who read them to the soldiers before the general had seen them.<a id="id_2page129"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="129"></a> He then gave orders that one of the mutineers should be put in irons, more by way of vindicating his authority than because one man was especially to blame. Leaving Bonn, the army moved on to Cologne, where they were joined by large numbers of Gallic auxiliaries, who at first zealously supported the Roman cause: later, when the Germans prospered, most of the tribes took arms against us, actuated by hopes of liberty and an ambition to establish an empire of their own when once they had shaken off the yoke.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the army's indignation steadily increased. The imprisonment of a single soldier was not enough to terrify them, and, indeed, the prisoner actually accused the general of complicity in crime, alleging that he himself had carried messages between Flaccus and Civilis. 'It is because I can testify to the truth,' he said, 'that Flaccus wants to get rid of me on a false charge.' Thereupon Vocula, with admirable self-possession, mounted the tribunal and, in spite of the man's protestations, ordered him to be seized and led away to prison. This alarmed the disaffected, while the better sort obeyed him promptly. The army then unanimously demanded that Vocula should lead them, and Flaccus accordingly resigned the chief command to him. <a id="IVchap26"/><span class="chapnum">26</span>However, there was much to exasperate their disaffection. They were short both of pay and of provisions: the Gauls refused either to enlist or to pay tribute: drought, usually unknown in that climate, made the Rhine almost too low for navigation, and thus hampered their commissariat: patrols had <a id="id_2page130"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="130"></a>to be posted at intervals all along the bank to prevent the Germans fording the river: and in consequence of all this they had less food and more mouths to eat it. To the ignorant the lowness of the river seemed in itself an evil omen, as though the ancient bulwarks of the empire were now failing them. In peace they would have called it bad luck or the course of nature: now it was 'fate' and 'the anger of heaven'.</p>
<p>On entering <a id="id_2fnm306"/>Novaesium<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn306" class="2fnnum pginternal">306</a> they were joined by the Sixteenth legion. Herennius <a id="id_2fnm307"/>Gallus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn307" class="2fnnum pginternal">307</a> now shared with Vocula the responsibility of command. As they could not venture out against the enemy, they encamped ... at a place called <a id="id_2fnm308"/>Gelduba,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn308" class="2fnnum pginternal">308</a> where the soldiers were trained in deploying, in fortification and entrenchment, and in various other military manœuvres. To inspire their courage with the further incentive of plunder, Vocula led out part of the force against the neighbouring tribe of the <a id="id_2fnm309"/>Cugerni,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn309" class="2fnnum pginternal">309</a> who had accepted Civilis' offers of alliance. The rest of the troops were left behind with Herennius <a id="id_2fnm310"/>Gallus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn310" class="2fnnum pginternal">310</a> <a id="IVchap27"/><span class="chapnum">27</span>and it happened that a corn-ship with a full cargo, which had run aground close to the camp, was towed over by the Germans to their own bank. This was more than Gallus could tolerate, so he sent a cohort to the rescue. The number of the Germans soon in<a id="id_2page131"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="131"></a>creased: both sides gradually gathered reinforcements and a regular battle was fought, with the result that the Germans towed off the ship, inflicting heavy losses. The defeated troops followed what had now become their regular custom, and threw the blame not on their own inefficiency but on their commanding-officer's bad faith. They dragged him from his quarters, tore his uniform and flogged him, bidding him tell them how much he had got for betraying the army, and who were his accomplices. Then their indignation recoiled on Hordeonius Flaccus: he was the real criminal: Gallus was only his tool. At last their threats so terrified Gallus that he, too, charged Flaccus with treason. He was put in irons until the arrival of Vocula, who at once set him free, and on the next day had the ringleaders of the riot executed. The army showed, indeed, a strange contrast in its equal readiness to mutiny and to submit to punishment. The common soldiers' loyalty to Vitellius was beyond <a id="id_2fnm311"/>question,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn311" class="2fnnum pginternal">311</a> while the higher ranks inclined towards Vespasian. Thus we find a succession of outbreaks and penalties; an alternation of insubordination with obedience to discipline; for the troops could be punished though not controlled.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap28"/><span class="chapnum">28</span>Meanwhile the whole of Germany was ready to worship Civilis, sending him vast reinforcements and ratifying the alliance with hostages from their noblest families. He gave orders that the country of the Ubii and Treviri was to be laid waste by their nearest <a id="id_2page132"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="132"></a>neighbours, and sent another party across the Maas to harass the Menapii and <a id="id_2fnm312"/>Morini<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn312" class="2fnnum pginternal">312</a> and other frontier tribes of Gaul. In both quarters they plundered freely, and were especially savage towards the Ubii, because they were a tribe of German origin who had renounced their fatherland and adopted the name of Agrippinenses.<a id="id_2fnm313"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn313" class="2fnnum pginternal">313</a> A Ubian cohort was cut to pieces at the village of <a id="id_2fnm314"/>Marcodurum,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn314" class="2fnnum pginternal">314</a> where they were off their guard, trusting to their distance from the Rhine. The Ubii did not take this quietly, nor hesitate to seek reprisals from the Germans, which they did at first with impunity. In the end, however, the Germans proved too much for them, and throughout the war the Ubii were always more conspicuous for good faith than good fortune. Their collapse strengthened Civilis' position, and emboldened by success, he now vigorously pressed on the blockade of the legions at Vetera, and redoubled his vigilance to prevent any message creeping through from the relieving army. The Batavians were told off to look after the engines and siege-works: the Germans, who clamoured for battle, were sent to demolish the rampart and renew the fight directly they were beaten off. There were so many of them that their losses mattered little.</p>
<p><a id="IVchap29"/><span class="chapnum">29</span>Nightfall did not see the end of their task. They built huge fires of wood all round the ramparts and <a id="id_2page133"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="133"></a>sat drinking by them; then, as the wine warmed their hearts, one by one they dashed into the fight with blind courage. In the darkness their missiles were ineffective, but the barbarian troops were clearly visible to the Romans, and any one whose daring or bright ornaments made him conspicuous at once became a mark for their aim. At last Civilis saw their mistake, and gave orders to extinguish the fires and plunge the whole scene into a confusion of darkness and the din of arms. Discordant shouts now arose: everything was vague and uncertain: no one could see to strike or to parry. Wherever a shout was heard, they would wheel round and lunge in that direction. Valour was useless: chance and chaos ruled supreme: and the bravest soldier often fell under a coward's bolt. The Germans fought with blind fury. The Roman troops were more familiar with danger; they hurled down iron-clamped stakes and heavy stones with sure effect. Wherever the sound of some one climbing or the clang of a scaling-ladder betrayed the presence of the enemy, they thrust them back with their shields and followed them with a shower of javelins. Many appeared on top of the walls, and these they stabbed with their short swords. And so the night wore on. <a id="IVchap30"/><span class="chapnum">30</span>Day dawned upon new methods of attack. The Batavians had built a wooden tower of two stories and moved it up to the Head-quarters <a id="id_2fnm315"/>Gate,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-15.htm.html#id_2fn315" class="2fnnum pginternal">315</a> which was the most accessible spot. However, our soldiers, by using strong poles and hurling wooden beams, soon <a id="id_2page134"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="134"></a>battered it to pieces, with great loss of life to those who were standing on it. While they were still dismayed at this, we made a sudden and successful sally. Meanwhile the legionaries, with remarkable skill and ingenuity, invented still further contrivances. The one which caused most terror was a crane with a movable arm suspended over their assailants' heads: this arm was suddenly lowered, snatched up one or more of the enemy into the air before his fellows' eyes, and, as the heavy end was swung round, tossed him into the middle of the camp. Civilis now gave up hope of storming the camp and renewed a leisurely blockade, trying all the time by messages and offers of reward to undermine the loyalty of the legions.</p>
