<h3 id="pgepubid00030"><a id="The_Revolt_of_Vespasian"/>The Revolt of Vespasian</h3>
<p><a id="IIchap73"/><span class="chapnum">73</span>When once his couriers brought news from Syria and Judaea that the East had sworn allegiance to him, Vitellius' vanity and indolence reached a pitch which is almost incredible. For already, though the rumours were still vague and unreliable, Vespasian's name was in everybody's mouth, and the mention of him often roused Vitellius to alarm. Still, he and his army seemed to reck of no rival: they at once broke out into the unbridled cruelty, debauchery and oppression of some outlandish court.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap74"/><span class="chapnum">74</span>Vespasian, on the other hand, was meditating war and reckoning all his forces both distant and near at hand. He had so much attached his troops to himself, that when he dictated to them the oath of allegiance and prayed that 'all might be well' with Vitellius, they listened in silence. Mucianus' feelings were not hostile to him, and were strongly sympathetic to Titus. Tiberius Alexander,<a id="id_1fnm392"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn392" class="fnnum pginternal">392</a> the Governor of Egypt, had made common cause with him. The Third <a id="id_1fnm393"/>legion,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn393" class="fnnum pginternal">393</a> since it had crossed from Syria into Moesia, he could reckon as his own, and there was good hope that the other legions of Illyria would follow its <a id="id_1fnm394"/>lead.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn394" class="fnnum pginternal">394</a> The whole <a id="id_1page181"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="181"></a>army, indeed, was incensed at the arrogance of Vitellius' soldiers: truculent in appearance and rough of tongue, they scoffed at all the other troops as their inferiors. But a war of such magnitude demands delay. High as were his hopes, Vespasian often calculated his risks. He realized that it would be a critical day for him when he committed his sixty summers and his two young sons to the chances of war. In his private ambitions a man may feel his way and take less or more from fortune's hands according as he feels inclined, but when one covets a throne there is no alternative between the zenith of success and headlong ruin. <a id="IIchap75"/><span class="chapnum">75</span>Moreover, he always kept in view the strength of the German army, which, as a soldier, he realized. His own legions, he knew, had no experience of civil war, while Vitellius' troops were fresh from victory: and the defeated party were richer in grievances than in troops. Civil strife had undermined the loyalty of the troops: there was danger in each single man. What would be the good of all his horse and foot, if one or two traitors should seek the reward the enemy offered and assassinate him then and there? It was thus that <a id="id_1fnm395"/>Scribonianus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn395" class="fnnum pginternal">395</a> had been killed in Claudius' reign, and his murderer, Volaginius, raised from a common soldier to the highest rank. It is easier to move men in the mass than to take precautions against them singly.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap76"/><span class="chapnum">76</span>These anxieties made Vespasian hesitate. Meanwhile the other generals and his friends continued to <a id="id_1page182"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="182"></a>encourage him. At last Mucianus after several private interviews went so far as to address him in public. 'Everybody,' he said, 'who plans some great exploit is bound to consider whether his enterprise serves both the public interest and his own reputation, and whether it is easily practicable or, at any rate, not impossible. He must also weigh the advice which he gets. Are those who offer it ready to run the risk themselves? And, if fortune favours, who gains the glory? I myself, Vespasian, call you to the throne. How much that may benefit the country and make you famous it lies with you‚Äîunder Providence‚Äîto decide. You need not be afraid that I may seem to flatter you. It is more of an insult than a compliment to be chosen to succeed Vitellius. It is not against the powerful intellect of the sainted Augustus that we are in revolt; not against the cautious prudence of the old Tiberius; nor even against a long-established imperial family like that of Caligula, Claudius or Nero. You even gave way to Galba's ancient lineage. To remain inactive any longer, to leave your country to ruin and disgrace, that would be sheer sloth and cowardice, even if such slavery were as safe for you as it would be dishonourable. The time is long past when you could be merely <i>suspected</i> of ambition: the throne is now your only refuge. Have you forgotten Corbulo's <a id="id_1fnm396"/>murder?<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn396" class="fnnum pginternal">396</a> He was a man of better family than we, I admit, but so <a id="id_1page183"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="183"></a>was Nero more nobly born than Vitellius. A man who is feared always seems illustrious enough to those who fear him. That an army can make an emperor Vitellius himself has proved. He had neither experience nor military reputation, but merely rose on Galba's unpopularity. Even Otho fell not by the strategy or strength of his opponent, but by his own precipitate despair. And to-day he seems a great and desirable emperor, when Vitellius is disbanding his legions, disarming his Guards, and daily sowing fresh seeds of civil war. Why, any spirit or enthusiasm which his army had is being dissipated in drunken debauches: for they imitate their master. But you, in Judaea, in Syria, in Egypt, you have nine fresh legions. War has not weakened nor mutiny demoralized them. The men are trained to discipline and have already won a foreign <a id="id_1fnm397"/>war.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn397" class="fnnum pginternal">397</a> Besides these, you can rely on the strength of your <a id="id_1fnm398"/>fleet,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn398" class="fnnum pginternal">398</a> and of your auxiliaries both horse and foot, on the faithful allegiance of foreign <a id="id_1fnm399"/>princes,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn399" class="fnnum pginternal">399</a> and on your own unparalleled experience.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap77"/><span class="chapnum">77</span>'For ourselves I make but one claim. Let us not rank below Valens and Caecina. Nor must you despise my help because you do not encounter my rivalry. I prefer myself to Vitellius and you to myself. Your house has received the insignia of a <a id="id_1fnm400"/>triumph.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn400" class="fnnum pginternal">400</a> You <a id="id_1page184"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="184"></a>have two young sons, one of whom is already old enough to fill the throne, and in his first years of service made a name for himself in the German <a id="id_1fnm401"/>army.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn401" class="fnnum pginternal">401</a> It would be absurd for me not to give way to one whose son I should adopt, were I emperor myself. Apart from this, we shall stand on a different footing in success and in failure, for if we succeed I shall have such honour as you grant me: of the risk and the dangers we shall share the burden equally. Or rather, do what is better still. Dispose your armies yourself and leave me the conduct of the war, and the uncertainties of battle.</p>
<p>'At this moment the defeated are far more strictly disciplined than their conquerors. Indignation, hatred, the passion for revenge, all serve to steel our courage. Theirs is dulled by pride and mutiny. The course of the war will soon bring to light the hidden weakness of their party, and reopen all its festering sores. I rely on your vigilance, your economy, your wisdom, and still more on the indolence, ignorance, and cruelty of Vitellius. Above all, our cause is far safer in war than in peace, for those who plan rebellion have rebelled already.'</p>
<p><a id="IIchap78"/><span class="chapnum">78</span>At the end of Mucianus' speech the others all pressed round with new confidence, offering their encouragement and quoting the answers of soothsayers and the movements of the stars. Nor was Vespasian uninfluenced by superstition. In later days, when he <a id="id_1page185"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="185"></a>was master of the world, he made no secret of keeping a soothsayer called Seleucus to help him by his advice and prophecy. Early omens began to recur to his memory. A tall and conspicuous cypress on his estate had once suddenly collapsed: on the next day it had risen again on the same spot to grow taller and broader than ever. The soothsayers had agreed that this was an omen of great success, and augured the height of fame for the still youthful Vespasian. At first his triumphal honours, his consulship, and the name he won by his Jewish victory seemed to have fulfilled the promise of this omen. But having achieved all this, he began to believe that it portended his rise to the throne.</p>
<p>On the frontier of Judaea and <a id="id_1fnm402"/>Syria<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn402" class="fnnum pginternal">402</a> lies a hill called Carmel. A god of the same name is there worshipped according to ancient ritual. There is no image or temple: only an altar where they reverently worship. Once when Vespasian was sacrificing on this altar, brooding on his secret ambition, the priest, Basilides, after a minute inspection of the omens said to him: 'Whatever it is which you have in mind, Vespasian, whether it is to build a house or to enlarge your estate, or to increase the number of your slaves, there is granted to you a great habitation, vast acres, and a multitude of men.' Rumour had immediately seized on this riddle and now began to solve it. Nothing was more talked of, especially in Vespasian's presence: such conversation is the food of hope.</p>
<p><a id="id_1page186"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="186"></a></p>
<p>Having come to a definite decision they departed, Mucianus to Antioch, Vespasian to Caesarea. The former is the capital of Syria, the latter of <a id="id_1fnm403"/>Judaea.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn403" class="fnnum pginternal">403</a></p>
<p><a id="IIchap79"/><span class="chapnum">79</span>The first offer of the throne to Vespasian was made at Alexandria, where Tiberius Alexander with great promptitude administered the oath of allegiance to his troops on the first of July. This was usually celebrated as his day of accession, although it was not until the third that the Jewish army took the oath in his presence. So eager was their enthusiasm that they would not even wait for the arrival of Titus, who was on his way back from Syria, where he had been conducting the negotiations between his father and Mucianus.</p>
<p>What happened was all due to the impulse of the soldiers: there was no set speech, no formal assembly of the troops. <a id="IIchap80"/><span class="chapnum">80</span>They were still discussing the time and the place, and trying to decide the hardest point of all, who should speak first, and while their minds were still busy with hopes and fears, reasons and chances, Vespasian happened to come out of his quarters. A few of the soldiers, forming up in the usual way to salute their general, saluted him as emperor. The others promptly rushed up calling him Caesar and Augustus, and heaping on him all the imperial titles. Their fears at once gave way to confidence. Vespasian himself, unchanged by the change of fortune, showed <a id="id_1page187"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="187"></a>no sign of vanity or arrogance. As soon as he had recovered from the dazzling shock of his sudden elevation, he addressed them in simple soldier fashion, and received a shower of congratulations from every quarter. Mucianus, who had been waiting for this, administered the oath of allegiance to his eager troops, and then entered the theatre at Antioch, where the Greeks ordinarily hold their debates. There, as the fawning crowd came flocking in, he addressed them in their own tongue. For he could speak elegant Greek, and had the art of making the most of all he said or did. What most served to inflame the excitement of the province and of the army, was his statement that Vitellius had determined to transfer the German legions to peaceful service in the rich province of Syria, and to send the Syrian legions to endure the toil and rigours of a winter in Germany. The provincials were accustomed to the soldiers' company and liked to have them quartered there, and many were bound to them by ties of intimacy and kinship, while the soldiers in their long term of service had come to know and love their old camp like a home.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap81"/><span class="chapnum">81</span>Before the 15th of July the whole of Syria had sworn allegiance. The party also gained the support of <a id="id_1fnm404"/>Sohaemus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn404" class="fnnum pginternal">404</a> with all the resources of his kingdom and a considerable force, and of Antiochus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn404" class="fnnum pginternal">404</a> the richest of the subject princes, who owed his importance to his ancestral treasures. Before long Agrippa, too, received a secret summons from his friends at home, and leaving <a id="id_1page188"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="188"></a>Rome<a id="id_1fnm405"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn405" class="fnnum pginternal">405</a> without the knowledge of Vitellius, sailed as fast as he could to join Vespasian. His sister <a id="id_1fnm406"/>Berenice<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn406" class="fnnum pginternal">406</a> showed equal enthusiasm for the cause. She was then in the flower of her youth and beauty, and her munificent gifts to Vespasian quite won the old man's heart. Indeed, every province on the seaboard as far as Asia and Achaia, and inland to Pontus and Armenia swore allegiance to Vespasian, but their governors were without troops, for as yet no legions had been assigned to <a id="id_1fnm407"/>Cappadocia.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn407" class="fnnum pginternal">407</a></p>
<p>A meeting was held at <a id="id_1fnm408"/>Berytus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn408" class="fnnum pginternal">408</a> to discuss the general situation. To this came Mucianus with all his officers and the most distinguished of his centurions and soldiers, besides the elite of the Jewish army in full uniform. All these cavalry and infantry, and the pageant of the subject princes, vying with each other in splendour, gave the meeting an air of imperial grandeur.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap82"/><span class="chapnum">82</span>The first step was to levy new troops and to recall the veterans to the standards. Some of the strongest towns were told off to manufacture arms. New gold and silver were coined at Antioch. All these works were promptly carried out, each in the proper place, by competent officials. Vespasian came and inspected them himself, encouraging good work by his praises <a id="id_1page189"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="189"></a>and rousing the inefficient rather by example than compulsion, always more ready to see the merits than the faults of his friends. Many were rewarded by receiving commands in the auxiliary forces or posts as imperial agents.<a id="id_1fnm409"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn409" class="fnnum pginternal">409</a> Still more were raised to senatorial rank. They were mostly men of distinction who soon rose high, and with others success atoned for any lack of merit. A donation for the troops had been mentioned by Mucianus in his first speech, but in very guarded terms. Even Vespasian offered for the civil war a lower figure than others gave in time of peace, for he had set his face with admirable firmness against largess to the soldiers, and his army was none the worse for it. Envoys were dispatched to Parthia and Armenia to secure that the legions, while engaged in the civil war, should not be exposed to attack in the <a id="id_1fnm410"/>rear.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn410" class="fnnum pginternal">410</a> It was arranged that Titus should carry on the war in Judaea, while Vespasian held the keys of Egypt.<a id="id_1fnm411"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn411" class="fnnum pginternal">411</a> Against Vitellius it seemed sufficient to send a part of their forces under the command of Mucianus. He would have Vespasian's name behind him and the <a id="id_1page190"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="190"></a>irresistible force of destiny. Letters were written to all the armies and their generals with instructions that they should try to win over those of the Guards who were hostile to Vitellius by promising them renewal of service.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap83"/><span class="chapnum">83</span>Meanwhile, Mucianus, who acted the part more of a partner than a subordinate, moved forward without the encumbrance of baggage, neither marching so slowly as to look like holding back, nor so rapidly as not to allow time for rumours to spread. He realized that his force was small, and that the less people saw the more they would believe of it. However, he had a solid column following in support, composed of the Sixth legion and some picked detachments numbering 13,000 <a id="id_1fnm412"/>men.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn412" class="fnnum pginternal">412</a> He had ordered the fleet to move from Pontus to Byzantium, for he was half-minded to leave Moesia and with his whole force to hold Dyrrachium, at the same time using his fleet to dominate the Italian sea. He would thus secure Greece and Asia in his rear, which would otherwise be at the mercy of Vitellius, unless furnished with troops. Vitellius also would himself be in doubt what points of the Italian coast to defend, if Mucianus with his ships threatened both Brundisium and Tarentum and the whole coastline of Calabria and Lucania.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap84"/><span class="chapnum">84</span>Thus the provinces rang from end to end with the preparations for ships, soldiers and arms. But the <a id="id_1page191"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="191"></a>heaviest burden was the raising of money. 'Funds,' said Mucianus, 'are the sinews of war,'<a id="id_1fnm413"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn413" class="fnnum pginternal">413</a> and in his investigations he cared for neither justice nor equity, but solely for the amount of the sum. Informers abounded, and pounced on every rich man as their prey. This intolerable oppression, excused by the necessities of war, was allowed to continue even in peace. It was not so much that Vespasian at the beginning of his reign had made up his mind to maintain unjust decisions, but fortune spoilt him; he had learnt in a bad school and made a bold use of his lessons. Mucianus also contributed from his private means, of which he was generous, as he hoped to get a high rate of interest out of the country. Others followed his example, but very few had his opportunity of recovering their money.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap85"/><span class="chapnum">85</span>In the meantime Vespasian's progress was accelerated by the enthusiasm with which the Illyrian <a id="id_1fnm414"/>army<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn414" class="fnnum pginternal">414</a> espoused his cause. The Third set the example to the other legions of Moesia, the Eighth and the Seventh Claudian, both strongly attached to Otho, although they had not been present at the battle. On their arrival at <a id="id_1fnm415"/>Aquileia<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn415" class="fnnum pginternal">415</a> they had mobbed the couriers who brought the news of Otho's fall, and torn to pieces the standards bearing Vitellius' name, finally looting the camp-chest and dividing the money among themselves. <a id="id_1page192"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="192"></a>These were hostile acts. Alarmed at what they had done they began to reflect that, while their conduct needed excuse before Vitellius, they could make a merit of it with Vespasian. Accordingly, the three Moesian legions addressed letters to the Pannonian <a id="id_1fnm416"/>army,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn416" class="fnnum pginternal">416</a> inviting their co-operation, and meanwhile prepared to meet refusal with force.</p>
<p>Aponius Saturninus, the Governor of Moesia, took this opportunity to attempt an abominable crime. He sent a centurion to murder Tettius Julianus,<a id="id_1fnm417"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn417" class="fnnum pginternal">417</a> who commanded the Seventh legion, alleging the interests of his party as a cloak for a personal quarrel. Julianus heard of his danger and, taking some guides who knew the country, escaped into the wilds of Moesia and got as far as Mount Haemus.<a id="id_1fnm418"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn418" class="fnnum pginternal">418</a> After that he meddled no more in civil war. Starting to join Vespasian, he prolonged his journey by various expedients, retarding or hastening his pace according to the nature of the news he received.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap86"/><span class="chapnum">86</span>In Pannonia the Thirteenth legion and the Seventh Galbian had not forgotten their feelings after the battle of Bedriacum. They lost no time in joining Vespasian's cause, being chiefly instigated by Antonius Primus. This man was a criminal who had been convicted of <a id="id_1fnm419"/>fraud<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn419" class="fnnum pginternal">419</a> during Nero's reign. Among the many evils of the war was his recovery of senatorial <a id="id_1page193"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="193"></a>rank. Galba gave him command of the Seventh legion, and he was believed to have written repeatedly to Otho offering his services as general to the party. But, as Otho took no notice of him, he was without employment in the war. When Vitellius' cause began to decline, he joined Vespasian and proved an acquisition. He was a man of great physical energy and a ready tongue; an artist in calumny, invaluable in riots and sedition. Light-fingered and free-handed, he was intolerable in peace, but by no means contemptible in war. The union of the Moesian and Pannonian armies soon attracted the troops in Dalmatia to the cause. Tampius Flavianus and Pompeius Silvanus, the two ex-consuls who governed respectively Pannonia and <a id="id_1fnm420"/>Dalmatia,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn420" class="fnnum pginternal">420</a> were wealthy old gentlemen who had no thought of rising. But the imperial agent in Pannonia, Cornelius Fuscus, was a vigorous young man of good family. In his early youth a desire to make <a id="id_1fnm421"/>money<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn421" class="fnnum pginternal">421</a> had led him to resign his senatorial rank. He <a id="id_1page194"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="194"></a>had headed the townsmen of his colony in declaring for Galba, and his services had won him a position as imperial <a id="id_1fnm422"/>agent.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn422" class="fnnum pginternal">422</a> Then he joined Vespasian's party, giving a keen stimulus to the war; for, being attracted more by danger itself than by its prizes, he always disliked what was certain and long established, preferring everything that was new and dangerous and doubtful. So the Vespasian party used all their efforts to fan every spark of discontent throughout the empire. Letters were sent to the Fourteenth in Britain and to the First in <a id="id_1fnm423"/>Spain,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-8.htm.html#id_1fn423" class="fnnum pginternal">423</a> since both these legions had stood for Otho against Vitellius. In Gaul, too, letters were scattered broadcast. All in an instant the war was in full flame. The armies of Illyricum openly revolted, and all the others were ready to follow the first sign of success.</p>

It is more likely that his motives were mercenary, since both law and custom still imposed some restrictions upon a senator's participation in 'business'. In the <i>Annals</i> (xvi. 17) Tacitus says that Annaeus Mela abstained from seeking public office, because he 'hoped to find a shorter road to wealth' by entering, as Fuscus did, the imperial civil service.

<h3 id="pgepubid00031"><a id="Vitellius_in_Rome"/>Vitellius in Rome</h3>
<p><a id="IIchap87"/><span class="chapnum">87</span>While<a id="id_1fnm424"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn424" class="fnnum pginternal">424</a> Vespasian and his generals were showing such activity in the provinces, Vitellius grew more contemptible and indolent every day. Halting at every town or country house that offered any attractions, he made his way to Rome with a heavy marching column of sixty thousand troops, demoralized by loose discipline, and an even greater number of menials as well as those camp-followers who are more troublesome than any slaves. Besides these he had the vast retinue of his generals and friends, which not even the strictest discipline could have kept under control. This mob <a id="id_1page195"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="195"></a>was further encumbered by senators and knights, who came from Rome to meet him, some from fear, some from servility; and gradually all the others followed, so as not to be left behind by themselves. There flocked in, too, a crowd of low-bred buffoons, actors and chariot-drivers, who had gained Vitellius' acquaintance by various dishonest services. He delighted in such discreditable connexions. To furnish supplies for this host not only were the colonies and country towns laid under contribution, but the farmers as well. The crops were just ripe and the fields were ravaged like an enemy's country.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap88"/><span class="chapnum">88</span>Many murderous affrays took place among the soldiers, for after the mutiny at <a id="id_1fnm425"/>Ticinum<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn425" class="fnnum pginternal">425</a> there were ceaseless quarrels between the legions and the auxiliaries. They only united to harry the villagers. The worst bloodshed took place at the seventh milestone from Rome. Here Vitellius had ready-cooked food served to each of the soldiers, as is done with gladiators in training, and the common people flocked out from Rome and wandered all over the camp. Some of these visitors indulged in a cockney practical joke,<a id="id_1fnm426"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn426" class="fnnum pginternal">426</a> and stole some of the soldiers' swords, quietly cutting their belts while their attention was diverted. Then they kept asking them, 'Have you got your sword <a id="id_1page196"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="196"></a>on?' The troops were not used to being laughed at, and refused to tolerate it. They charged the defenceless crowd. Amongst others the father of one of the soldiers was killed while in his son's company. When it was discovered who he was, and the news spread, they shed no more innocent blood. Still there was some panic in the city as the first soldiers arrived and began to roam the streets. They mostly made for the Forum, anxious to see the spot where Galba had <a id="id_1fnm427"/>fallen.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn427" class="fnnum pginternal">427</a> They themselves were a sufficiently alarming sight with their rough skin coats and long pikes. Unused to towns, they failed to pick their way in the crowd; or they would slip on the greasy streets, or collide with some one and tumble down, whereupon they took to abuse and before long to violence. Their officers, too, terrified the city by sweeping along the streets with their bands of armed men.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap89"/><span class="chapnum">89</span>After crossing the Mulvian bridge, Vitellius himself had been riding on a conspicuous horse, wearing his sword and general's uniform, with the senate and people trooping in front of him. However, as this looked too much like an entry into a captured city, his friends persuaded him to change into civilian dress and walk on foot. At the head of his column were carried the eagles of four legions, surrounded by the colours belonging to the detachments of four other <a id="id_1fnm428"/>legions.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn428" class="fnnum pginternal">428</a> Next came the standards of twelve regiments of <a id="id_1page197"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="197"></a>auxiliary horse, then the files of infantry and the cavalry behind them. Then came thirty-four cohorts of auxiliaries, arranged according to their nationality or the nature of their weapons. In front of the eagles came the camp prefects and tribunes, and the senior <a id="id_1fnm429"/>centurions,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn429" class="fnnum pginternal">429</a> all dressed in white. The other centurions marched each at the head of his company, glittering with their armour and decorations. Gaily, too, shone the soldiers' <a id="id_1fnm430"/>medals<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn430" class="fnnum pginternal">430</a> and their chains of honour. It was a noble spectacle, an army worthy of a better emperor. Thus Vitellius entered the Capitol, where he embraced his mother and conferred on her the title of Augusta.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap90"/><span class="chapnum">90</span>On the following day Vitellius delivered a grandiloquent eulogy on his own merits. He might have been addressing the senate and people of some other state, for he extolled his own industry and self-control, although each member of his audience had seen his infamy for himself, and the whole of Italy had witnessed during his march the shameful spectacle of his sloth and luxury. However, the thoughtless crowd could not discriminate between truth and falsehood. They had learnt the usual flatteries by heart and chimed in with loud shouts of applause. They insisted in the face of his protests that he should take the title of <a id="id_1page198"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="198"></a>Augustus. But neither his refusal nor their insistence made much <a id="id_1fnm431"/>difference.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn431" class="fnnum pginternal">431</a></p>
<p><a id="IIchap91"/><span class="chapnum">91</span>In Rome nothing passes without comment, and it was regarded as a fatal omen that Vitellius took office as high priest, and issued his encyclical on public worship on the 18th of July, which, as the anniversary of the disasters on the Cremera and the Allia,<a id="id_1fnm432"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn432" class="fnnum pginternal">432</a> had long been considered an unlucky day. But his ignorance of all civil and religious precedent was only equalled by the incapacity of his freedmen and friends. He seemed to live in a society of drunkards. However, at the consular elections he canvassed for his candidates like a common <a id="id_1fnm433"/>citizen.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn433" class="fnnum pginternal">433</a> In everything he courted the favour of the lowest classes, attending performances in the theatre and backing his favourite at the races. This would undoubtedly have made him popular had his motives been good, but the memory of his former life made his conduct seem cheap and discreditable. He constantly attended the senate, even when the debates were on trivial matters. It once happened that Helvidius Priscus,<a id="id_1fnm434"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn434" class="fnnum pginternal">434</a> then praetor-elect, opposed Vitellius' policy. At first the emperor showed annoyance, <a id="id_1page199"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="199"></a>but was content to appeal to the tribunes of the people to come to the rescue of his slighted authority. Afterwards, when his friends, fearing that his resentment might be deep-seated, tried to smooth matters, he replied that there was nothing strange in two senators disagreeing on a question of public policy: he himself had often opposed even such a man as Thrasea. Most people laughed at the impudence of this comparison; others were gratified that he had selected Thrasea, and not some court favourite, as an example of real <a id="id_1fnm435"/>distinction.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn435" class="fnnum pginternal">435</a></p>
<p><a id="IIchap92"/><span class="chapnum">92</span>Vitellius had given the command of the Guards to Publilius Sabinus, who had commanded an auxiliary <a id="id_1fnm436"/>cohort,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn436" class="fnnum pginternal">436</a> and Julius Priscus, hitherto only a centurion. Priscus owed his rise to Valens' support, Sabinus to that of Caecina. The rivalry between Valens and Caecina left Vitellius no authority at all. They managed the government between them. They had long felt the strain of mutual dislike. During the war they had concealed it. Lately it had been fanned by dishonest friends and by life in the city, which so easily breeds quarrels. They were constant rivals, comparing their respective popularity, the number of their retinue, the size of the crowds that came to wait upon them. <a id="id_1page200"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="200"></a>Meanwhile Vitellius let his favour alternate between them, for personal influence is not to be trusted beyond a certain limit. Meanwhile, they both feared and despised the emperor himself, who thus veered between sudden brusqueness and unseasonable flattery. However, they were not in the least deterred from seizing on the houses, gardens, and funds in the emperor's patronage, while the crowd of miserable and needy nobles, whom Galba had recalled from exile with their children, derived no assistance from the emperor's liberality. He earned the approval both of the upper classes and of the people by granting to the restored full rights over their <a id="id_1fnm437"/>freedmen.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn437" class="fnnum pginternal">437</a> But the freed slaves with characteristic meanness did all they could to invalidate the edict. They would hide their money with some obscure friend or in a rich patron's safe. Some, indeed, had passed into the imperial household and become more influential than their masters.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap93"/><span class="chapnum">93</span>As for the soldiers, the Guards' barracks were crowded, and the overflow spread through the city, finding shelter in colonnades and temples. They ceased to recognize any head-quarters, to go on guard, or to keep themselves in training, but fell victims to the attractions of city life and its unmentionable vices, until they deteriorated both physically and morally through idleness and debauchery. A number of them <a id="id_1page201"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="201"></a>even imperilled their lives by settling in the pestilent Vatican quarter, thus increasing the rate of mortality. They were close to the Tiber, and the Germans and Gauls, who were peculiarly liable to disease and could ill stand the heat, ruined their constitutions by their immoderate use of the river.<a id="id_1fnm438"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn438" class="fnnum pginternal">438</a> Moreover, the generals, either for bribes or to earn popularity, tampered with the rules of the service, enrolling sixteen regiments of <a id="id_1fnm439"/>Guards<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn439" class="fnnum pginternal">439</a> and four for the city garrison, each composed of a thousand men. In enlisting these troops Valens put himself forward as superior to Caecina, whose life he claimed to have saved. It is true, indeed, that his arrival had consolidated the party, and by his successful engagement he had silenced the current criticism of their slow marching. Besides which the whole of the army of Lower Germany was attached to Valens, and this is said to be the reason why Caecina's loyalty first wavered.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap94"/><span class="chapnum">94</span>Whatever indulgence Vitellius showed to his generals, he allowed still more licence to the troops. Each man chose his service. However unfit, he might enlist in <a id="id_1page202"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="202"></a>the Guards, if he preferred it. On the other hand, good soldiers were allowed, if they wished, to remain in the legions or the auxiliary cavalry. Many wished to do this who suffered from ill health and complained of the climate. However, the best soldiers were thus withdrawn from the legions and from the cavalry; and the Guards were robbed of their prestige when twenty thousand men were thus not so much selected for service with them as drafted at random from the whole army.</p>
<p>While Vitellius was addressing the troops, they demanded the execution of three Gallic chieftains, Asiaticus, Flavus, and Rufinus, on the ground that they had fought for <a id="id_1fnm440"/>.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn440" class="fnnum pginternal">440</a> Vitellius never checked these outcries. For, apart from the innate cowardice of his nature, he knew that his donation to the soldiers was nearly due, and that he had no money for it; so he freely granted all their other demands. The imperial freedmen were forced to contribute a sort of tax, proportionate to the number of their slaves. Meanwhile, his one serious occupation was extravagance. He built stables for chariot-drivers, filled the arena with gorgeous shows of gladiators and wild beasts, and fooled away his money as though he had more than he wanted.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap95"/><span class="chapnum">95</span>Moreover, Valens and Caecina celebrated Vitellius' <a id="id_1fnm441"/>birthday<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn441" class="fnnum pginternal">441</a> by holding gladiatorial shows in every quarter of Rome on a scale of magnificence hitherto unknown. Vitellius then gratified the rabble and scandalized all decent people by building altars in the Martian Plain, and holding a funeral service in honour of Nero. Victims were killed and burnt in public: the torch was applied by the Augustales, members of the college which Tiberius Caesar had founded in honour <a id="id_1page203"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="203"></a>of the Julian family, just as Romulus similarly commemorated King Tatius.</p>
<p>It was not yet four months since Vitellius' victory, and yet his freedman Asiaticus was as bad as a Polyclitus or a <a id="id_1fnm442"/>Patrobius,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn442" class="fnnum pginternal">442</a> or any of the favourites whose names were hated in earlier days. At this court no one strove to rise by honesty or capacity. There was only one road to power. By lavish banquets, costly profusion, and feats of gastronomy, you had to try and satisfy Vitellius' insatiable gluttony. He himself, without thought for the morrow, was well content to enjoy the present. It is believed that he squandered nine hundred million <a id="id_1fnm443"/>sesterces<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn443" class="fnnum pginternal">443</a> in these brief months. Truly it shows Rome's greatness and misfortune, that she endured Otho and Vitellius both in the same year, and suffered humiliation of every kind at the hands of men like Vinius and <a id="id_1fnm444"/>Fabius,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn444" class="fnnum pginternal">444</a> Icelus and Asiaticus, until at last they gave way to Mucianus and Marcellus‚Äîa change of men but not of manners.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap96"/><span class="chapnum">96</span>The first news of rebellion which reached Vitellius came from Aponius <a id="id_1fnm445"/>Saturninus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn445" class="fnnum pginternal">445</a> who, before himself going over to Vespasian's side, wrote to announce the desertion of the Third legion. But a sudden crisis makes a man nervous: Aponius did not tell the whole story. So the emperor's flattering friends began to explain it all away: what was the defection of a single legion, while the loyalty of the other armies remained <a id="id_1page204"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="204"></a>unshaken? Vitellius himself used the same language to the soldiers. He accused the men, who had been recently discharged from the <a id="id_1fnm446"/>Guards,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn446" class="fnnum pginternal">446</a> of spreading false rumours, and kept assuring them there was no fear of civil war. All mention of Vespasian was suppressed, and soldiers were sent round the city to frighten people into silence, which, of course, did more than anything else to make them talk.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap97"/><span class="chapnum">97</span>Vitellius, nevertheless, sent for reinforcements from Germany, Britain, and the Spanish provinces, though with a lack of urgency which was intended to conceal his straits. The provinces and their governors showed the same want of enthusiasm. Hordeonius Flaccus,<a id="id_1fnm447"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn447" class="fnnum pginternal">447</a> who had suspicions of the Batavi, was distracted with a war of his <a id="id_1fnm448"/>own,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn448" class="fnnum pginternal">448</a> while Vettius <a id="id_1fnm449"/>Bolanus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn449" class="fnnum pginternal">449</a> never had Britain under complete control: nor was the loyally of either beyond doubt. The Spanish provinces, where there was at the time no consular governor,<a id="id_1fnm450"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn450" class="fnnum pginternal">450</a> were equally slow. The three officers in command of the legions held an equal authority, and if Vitellius' cause had prospered, would have each outbid the other for his favour: but they all shared the resolve to leave his misfortunes alone. In Africa the legion and auxiliaries enlisted by Clodius Macer, and subsequently <a id="id_1page205"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="205"></a>disbanded by <a id="id_1fnm451"/>Galba,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn451" class="fnnum pginternal">451</a> took service again at Vitellius' orders, and at the same time all the young men of the province eagerly enlisted. Vitellius had been an honest and popular pro-consul in Africa, while Vespasian had been distrusted and disliked. The provincials took this as an earnest of their reigns; but experience proved them wrong.</p>
<p><a id="IIchap98"/><span class="chapnum">98</span>The military legate Valerius <a id="id_1fnm452"/>Festus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn452" class="fnnum pginternal">452</a> at first loyally seconded the enthusiasm of the province. After a while he began to waver. In his official letters and edicts he still acknowledged Vitellius, while in secret communication with Vespasian and ready to support whichever party proved successful. In Raetia and the Gallic provinces some centurions and men carrying letters and edicts from Vespasian were taken prisoners and sent to Vitellius, who had them executed. But most of these envoys escaped capture either by their own ingenuity or the loyal help of friends. Thus, while Vitellius' plans were known, Vespasian's were for the most part still a secret. This was partly due to Vitellius' negligence, but also to the fact that the garrisons on the Pannonian Alps stopped all messengers. By sea, too, the <a id="id_1fnm453"/>Etesian<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn453" class="fnnum pginternal">453</a> winds from the north-west favoured ships sailing eastward, but hindered the voyage from the East.</p>
<p><a id="id_1page206"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="206"></a></p>
<p><a id="IIchap99"/><span class="chapnum">99</span>Terrified at last by the imminence of invasion and the alarming news that reached him from all quarters, Vitellius instructed Caecina and Valens to prepare for war. Caecina was sent on ahead, Valens, who was just recovering from a serious illness, being delayed by his weak state of health. Great, indeed, was the change in the appearance of the German army as it marched out of Rome. There was neither energy in their muscles nor fire in their hearts. Slowly the column straggled on, their horses spiritless, their arms neglected. The men grumbled at the sun, the dust, the weather, and were as ready to quarrel as they were unwilling to work. To these disadvantages were added Caecina's inveterate self-seeking and his newly-acquired indolence. An overdose of success had made him slack and self-indulgent, or, if he was plotting treachery, this may have been one of his devices for demoralizing the army. It has often been believed that it was Flavius <a id="id_1fnm454"/>Sabinus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-9.htm.html#id_1fn454" class="fnnum pginternal">454</a> who, using Rubrius Gallus as his agent, tampered with Caecina's loyalty by promising that, if he came over, Vespasian would ratify any conditions. It may have occurred also to Caecina to remember his quarrels and rivalry with Valens, and to consider that, as he did not stand first with Vitellius, he had better acquire credit and influence with the new emperor.</p>
