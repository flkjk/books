<h2 id="pgepubid00008"><a id="BOOK_I"/>BOOK I</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00009"><a id="PREFACE"/>Preface</h3>
<p><a id="Ichap1"/><span class="chapnum">1</span>[<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 69.] I propose to begin my narrative with the second consulship of Servius Galba, in which Titus Vinius was his colleague. Many historians have dealt with the 820 years of the earlier period beginning with the foundation of Rome, and the story of the Roman Republic has been told with no less ability than truth. After the Battle of Actium, when the interests of peace were served by the centralization of all authority in the hands of one man, there followed a dearth of literary ability, and at the same time truth suffered more and more, partly from ignorance of politics, which were no longer a citizen's concern, partly from the growing taste for flattery or from hatred of the ruling house. So between malice on one side and servility on the other the interests of posterity were neglected. But historians find that a tone of flattery soon incurs the stigma of servility and earns for them the contempt of their readers, whereas people readily open their ears to the criticisms of envy, since malice makes a show of independence. Of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, I have known nothing either to my advantage or my hurt. I cannot deny that I originally owed my position to Vespasian, or that I was advanced by Titus and still <a id="id_1page18"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="18"></a>further promoted by Domitian;<a id="id_1fnm5"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn5" class="fnnum pginternal">5</a> but professing, as I do, unbiassed honesty, I must speak of no man either with hatred or affection. I have reserved for my old age, if life is spared to me, the reigns of the sainted Nerva and of the Emperor Trajan, which afford a richer and withal a safer theme:<a id="id_1fnm6"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn6" class="fnnum pginternal">6</a> for it is the rare fortune of these days that a man may think what he likes and say what he thinks.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap2"/><span class="chapnum">2</span>The story I now commence is rich in vicissitudes, grim with warfare, torn by civil strife, a tale of horror even during times of peace. It tells of four emperors slain by the sword, three several civil wars, an even larger number of foreign wars and some that were both at once: successes in the East, disaster in the West, disturbance in Illyricum, disaffection in the provinces of Gaul, the conquest of Britain and its immediate loss, the rising of the Sarmatian and Suebic tribes. It tells how Dacia had the privilege of exchanging blows with Rome, and how a pretender claiming to be Nero almost deluded the Parthians into declaring war. Now too Italy was smitten with new disasters, or disasters it had not witnessed for a long period of years. Towns along the rich coast of Campania were <a id="id_1page19"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="19"></a>submerged or buried. The city was devastated by fires, ancient temples were destroyed, and the Capitol itself was fired by Roman hands. Sacred rites were grossly profaned, and there were scandals in high <a id="id_1fnm7"/>places.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn7" class="fnnum pginternal">7</a> The sea swarmed with exiles and the island <a id="id_1fnm8"/>cliffs<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn8" class="fnnum pginternal">8</a> were red with blood. Worse horrors reigned in the city. To be rich or well-born was a crime: men were prosecuted for holding or for refusing office: merit of any kind meant certain ruin. Nor were the Informers more hated for their crimes than for their prizes: some carried off a priesthood or the consulship as their spoil, others won offices and influence in the imperial household: the hatred and fear they inspired worked universal havoc. Slaves were bribed against their masters, freedmen against their patrons, and, if a man had no enemies, he was ruined by his friends.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap3"/><span class="chapnum">3</span>However, the period was not so utterly barren as to yield no examples of heroism. There were mothers who followed their sons, and wives their husbands into exile: one saw here a kinsman's courage and there a son-in-law's devotion: slaves obstinately faithful even on the rack: distinguished men bravely facing the utmost straits and matching in their end the famous deaths of older times. Besides these manifold disasters to mankind there were portents in the sky and on the earth, thunderbolts and other <a id="id_1page20"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="20"></a>premonitions of good and of evil, some doubtful, some obvious. Indeed never has it been proved by such terrible disasters to Rome or by such clear evidence that Providence is concerned not with our peace of mind but rather with vengeance for our sin.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00010"><a id="The_State_of_the_Empire"/>The State of the Empire</h3>
<p><a id="Ichap4"/><span class="chapnum">4</span>Before I commence my task, it seems best to go back and consider the state of affairs in the city, the temper of the armies, the condition of the provinces, and to determine the elements of strength and weakness in the different quarters of the Roman world. By this means we may see not only the actual course of events, which is largely governed by chance, but also why and how they occurred.</p>
<p>The death of Nero, after the first outburst of joy with which it was greeted, soon aroused conflicting feelings not only among the senators, the people, and the soldiers in the city, but also among the generals and their troops abroad. It had divulged a secret of state: an emperor could be made elsewhere than at Rome. Still the senate was satisfied. They had immediately taken advantage of their liberty and were naturally emboldened against a prince who was new to the throne and, moreover, absent. The highest class of the <a id="id_1fnm9"/>knights<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn9" class="fnnum pginternal">9</a> seconded the senate's satisfaction. Respectable citizens, who were attached as clients or freedmen to the great families, and had seen their <a id="id_1page21"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="21"></a>patrons condemned or exiled, now revived their hopes. The lowest classes, who had grown familiar with the pleasures of the theatre and the circus, the most degraded of the slaves, and Nero's favourites who had squandered their property and lived on his discreditable bounty, all showed signs of depression and an eager greed for news.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap5"/><span class="chapnum">5</span>The troops in the <a id="id_1fnm10"/>city<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn10" class="fnnum pginternal">10</a> had long been inured to the allegiance of the Caesars, and it was more by the pressure of intrigue than of their own inclination that they came to desert Nero. They soon realized that the donation promised in Galba's name was not to be paid to them, and that peace would not, like war, offer opportunity for great services and rich rewards. Since they also saw that the new emperor's favour had been forestalled by the army which proclaimed him, they were ripe for revolution and were further instigated by their rascally Praefect Nymphidius Sabinus, who was plotting to be emperor himself. His design was as a matter of fact detected and quashed, but, though the ringleader was removed, many of the troops still felt conscious of their treason and could be heard commenting on Galba's senility and avarice. His austerity‚Äîa quality once admired and set high in soldiers' estimation‚Äîonly annoyed troops whose contempt for the old methods of discipline had been fostered by fourteen years of service <a id="id_1page22"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="22"></a>under Nero. They had come to love the emperors' vices as much as they once reverenced their virtues in older days. Moreover Galba had let fall a remark, which augured well for Rome, though it spelt danger to himself. 'I do not buy my soldiers,' he said, 'I select them.' And indeed, as things then stood, his words sounded incongruous.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00011"><a id="Galbas_Position"/>Galba's Position</h3>
<p><a id="Ichap6"/><span class="chapnum">6</span>Galba was old and ill. Of his two lieutenants Titus Vinius was the vilest of men and Cornelius Laco the laziest. Hated as he was for Vinius' crimes and despised for Laco's inefficiency, between them Galba soon came to ruin. His march from Spain was slow and stained with bloodshed. He executed Cingonius Varro, the consul-elect, and Petronius Turpilianus, an ex-consul, the former as an accomplice of Nymphidius, the latter as one of Nero's generals. They were both denied any opportunity of a hearing or defence‚Äîand might as well have been innocent. On his arrival at Rome the butchery of thousands of unarmed <a id="id_1fnm11"/>soldiers<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn11" class="fnnum pginternal">11</a> gave an ill omen to his entry, and alarmed even the men who did the slaughter. The city was filled with strange troops. A legion had been brought from Spain,<a id="id_1fnm12"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn12" class="fnnum pginternal">12</a> and the regiment of marines enrolled by Nero still remained.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn11" class="fnnum pginternal">11</a> Moreover there were several detachments <a id="id_1page23"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="23"></a>from Germany, Britain, and <a id="id_1fnm13"/>Illyricum,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn13" class="fnnum pginternal">13</a> which had been selected by Nero, dispatched to the Caspian <a id="id_1fnm14"/>Pass<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn14" class="fnnum pginternal">14</a> for the projected war against the Albanians, and subsequently recalled to aid in crushing the revolt of <a id="id_1fnm15"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn15" class="fnnum pginternal">15</a> These were all fine fuel for a revolution, and, although their favour centred on nobody in particular, there they were at the disposal of any one who had enterprise.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap7"/><span class="chapnum">7</span>It happened by chance that the news of the death of Clodius Macer and of Fonteius Capito arrived in Rome simultaneously. Macer,<a id="id_1fnm16"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn16" class="fnnum pginternal">16</a> who was undoubtedly raising a disturbance in Africa, was put to death by the imperial agent Trebonius Garutianus, acting under Galba's orders: <a id="id_1fnm17"/>Capito<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn17" class="fnnum pginternal">17</a> had made a similar attempt in Germany and was killed by two officers, Cornelius Aquinus and Fabius Valens, without waiting for instructions. While Capito had a foul reputation for extortion and loose living, some people yet believed <a id="id_1page24"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="24"></a>that he had withheld his hand from treason. His officers, they supposed, had urged him to declare war, and, when they could not persuade him, had gone on to charge him falsely with their own offence,<a id="id_1fnm18"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn18" class="fnnum pginternal">18</a> while Galba from weakness of character, or perhaps because he was afraid to inquire too far, approved what had happened for good or for ill, since it was past alteration. At any rate both executions were unpopular. Now that Galba was disliked, everything he did, whether right or wrong, made him more unpopular. His freedmen were all-powerful: money could do anything: the slaves were thirsting for an upheaval, and with so elderly an emperor were naturally expecting to see one soon. The evils of the new court were those of the old, and while equally oppressive were not so easily excused. Even Galba's age seemed comic and despicable to a populace that was used to the young Nero and compared the emperors, as such people will, in point of looks and personal attraction.</p>

<p><a id="Ichap8"/><span class="chapnum">8</span>Such then at Rome was the variety of feeling natural in so vast a population. To turn to the provinces abroad: Spain was under the command of Cluvius Rufus, a man of great eloquence, and more skilled in the arts of peace than of <a id="id_1fnm19"/>war.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn19" class="fnnum pginternal">19</a> The Gallic provinces had not forgotten : moreover, they <a id="id_1page25"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="25"></a>were bound to Galba by his recent grant of Roman citizenship and his rebate of their tribute for the future. The tribes, however, which lay nearest to the armies stationed in Germany had not received these honours: some even had lost part of their territory and were equally aggrieved at the magnitude of their own injuries and of their neighbours' benefits. The troops in Germany were proud of their recent victory, indignant at their treatment and perplexed by a nervous consciousness that they had supported the wrong side: a very dangerous state for so strong a force to be in. They had been slow to desert Nero, and <a id="id_1fnm20"/>Verginius<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn20" class="fnnum pginternal">20</a> did not immediately declare for Galba. Whether he really did not want the throne is doubtful: without question his soldiers made him the offer. The death of Fonteius Capito aroused the indignation even of those who had no right to complain. However, they still lacked a leader: Galba had sent for Verginius under a pretence of friendship, and, when he was not allowed to return and was even charged with treachery, the soldiers considered his case their own.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap9"/><span class="chapnum">9</span>The army of Upper Germany felt no respect for their commander, Hordeonius <a id="id_1fnm21"/>Flaccus.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn21" class="fnnum pginternal">21</a> Weakened by age and an affection of the feet he was without resolution or authority, and could not have controlled the mildest troops. These fiery spirits were only the further inflamed when they felt such a weak hand on the reins. The legions of Lower Germany had been <a id="id_1page26"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="26"></a>for some time without a commander,<a id="id_1fnm22"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn22" class="fnnum pginternal">22</a> until Aulus Vitellius appeared. He was the son of the Lucius Vitellius who had been censor and thrice <a id="id_1fnm23"/>consul,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn23" class="fnnum pginternal">23</a> and Galba thought this sufficient to impress the troops. The army in Britain showed no bad feeling. All through the disturbance of the civil wars no troops kept cleaner hands. This may have been because they were so far away and severed by the sea, or perhaps frequent engagements had taught them to keep their rancour for the enemy. Quiet ruled in Illyricum also, although the legions, which had been summoned by <a id="id_1fnm24"/>Nero,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn24" class="fnnum pginternal">24</a> while lingering in Italy had made overtures to Verginius. But the armies lay far apart, always a sound assistance to the maintenance of military discipline, since the men could neither share vices nor join forces.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap10"/><span class="chapnum">10</span>The East was still untroubled. Licinius Mucianus held Syria with four <a id="id_1fnm25"/>legions.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn25" class="fnnum pginternal">25</a> He was a man who was always famous, whether in good fortune or in bad. As a youth he was ambitious and cultivated the friendship of the great. Later he found himself in straitened circumstances and a very ambiguous position, and, suspecting Claudius' displeasure, he withdrew into the wilds of Asia, where he came as near to being an exile as afterwards to being an emperor. He was <a id="id_1page27"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="27"></a>a strange mixture of good and bad, of luxury and industry, courtesy and arrogance. In leisure he was self-indulgent, but full of vigour on service. His outward behaviour was praiseworthy, though ill was spoken of his private life. However, with those who were under him or near him, and with his colleagues he gained great influence by various devices, and seems to have been the sort of man who would more readily make an emperor than be one.</p>
<p>The Jewish war was being conducted by Flavius Vespasianus‚Äîappointed by Nero‚Äîwith three <a id="id_1fnm26"/>legions.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn26" class="fnnum pginternal">26</a> He had no ill-will against Galba, and nothing to hope from his fall. Indeed he had sent his son Titus to carry his compliments and offer allegiance, an incident we must reserve for its proper <a id="id_1fnm27"/>place.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn27" class="fnnum pginternal">27</a> It was only after Vespasian's rise that Roman society came to believe in the mysterious movings of Providence, and supposed that portents and oracles had predestined the throne for him and his family.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap11"/><span class="chapnum">11</span>Of Egypt and its garrison, ever since the days of the sainted Augustus, the knights of Rome have been uncrowned <a id="id_1fnm28"/>kings.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn28" class="fnnum pginternal">28</a> The province being difficult to reach, rich in crops, torn and tossed by fanaticism and sedition, ignorant of law, unused to bureaucratic government, it seemed wiser to keep it in the control <a id="id_1page28"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="28"></a>of the <a id="id_1fnm29"/>Household.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn29" class="fnnum pginternal">29</a> The governor at that date was Tiberius Alexander, himself a native of <a id="id_1fnm30"/>Egypt.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn30" class="fnnum pginternal">30</a> Africa and its legions, now that Clodius Macer had been <a id="id_1fnm31"/>executed,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-1.htm.html#id_1fn31" class="fnnum pginternal">31</a> were ready to put up with any ruler after their experience of a petty master. The two Mauretanias, Raetia, Noricum, Thrace, and the other provinces governed by procurators had their sympathies determined by the neighbourhood of troops, and always caught their likes or dislikes from the strongest army. The ungarrisoned provinces, and chief amongst these Italy, were destined to be the prize of war, and lay at the mercy of any master. Such was the state of the Roman world when Servius Galba, consul for the second time, and Titus Vinius his colleague, inaugurated the year which was to be their last, and almost the last for the commonwealth of Rome.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00013"><a id="The_German_Revolt"/>The German Revolt and the Adoption of Piso</h3>
<p><a id="Ichap12"/><span class="chapnum">12</span>A few days after the first of January a dispatch arrived from Belgica, in which Pompeius <a id="id_1fnm32"/>Propinquus,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn32" class="fnnum pginternal">32</a> the imperial agent, announced that the legions of <a id="id_1page29"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="29"></a>Upper Germany had broken their oath of allegiance and were clamouring for a new emperor, but that by way of tempering their treason they referred the final choice to the Senate and People of Rome. Galba had already been deliberating and seeking advice as to the adoption of a successor, and this occurrence hastened his plans. During all these months this question formed the current subject of gossip throughout the country; Galba was far spent in years and the general propensity for such a topic knew no check. Few people showed sound judgement or any spirit of patriotism. Many were influenced by foolish hopes and spread self-interested rumours pointing to some friend or patron, thereby also gratifying their hatred for Titus <a id="id_1fnm33"/>Vinius,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn33" class="fnnum pginternal">33</a> whose unpopularity waxed daily with his power. Galba's affability only served to strengthen the gaping ambition of his newly powerful friends, for his weakness and credulity halved the risk and doubled the reward of treason.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap13"/><span class="chapnum">13</span>The real power of the throne was divided between the consul, Titus Vinius, and Cornelius Laco, the prefect of the Guards; and an influence as great was enjoyed by Icelus, one of Galba's freedmen, who had been given the gold <a id="id_1fnm34"/>ring<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn34" class="fnnum pginternal">34</a> and was now greeted by the name of Marcianus. These three ordinarily disagreed, and followed each his own interest in smaller <a id="id_1page30"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="30"></a>matters: on the question of the succession they fell into two camps. Vinius was for Marcus Otho. Laco and Icelus were agreed not so much on any one as on any other. Galba was aware of the friendship between Otho and Vinius. Otho was a bachelor and Vinius had an unmarried daughter: so gossip, never reticent, pointed to them as father and son-in-law. Galba, one may suppose, felt some concern for his country, too. Why take the throne from Nero, if it was to be left to Otho? Otho had led a careless boyhood and a dissolute youth, and endeared himself to Nero by aping his vices. Thus it was to Otho, as being already in the secret, that Nero entrusted his favourite mistress, Poppaea Sabina,<a id="id_1fnm35"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn35" class="fnnum pginternal">35</a> until he could get rid of Octavia. Later he grew jealous and removed Otho to the province of Lusitania under cover of a governorship. Otho had been popular in his administration of the province, and was one of the first to join Galba's party. Being a man of action and one of the most distinguished of Galba's officers in the war, when once he had conceived the hope of succeeding him, he eagerly indulged it. Most of the soldiers were on his side and the Court supported him as Nero's double.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap14"/><span class="chapnum">14</span>After receiving the news of the German revolt, although Galba knew nothing for certain of Vitellius' <a id="id_1page31"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="31"></a>plans, he was fearful to what lengths the outbreak of the troops might go; so, being unable to trust the troops in the <a id="id_1fnm36"/>city,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn36" class="fnnum pginternal">36</a> he had recourse to what seemed his sole remedy and held an Imperial Election. Besides Vinius and Laco he summoned Marius Celsus, consul-elect and the City-Prefect Ducenius <a id="id_1fnm37"/>Geminus.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn37" class="fnnum pginternal">37</a> After prefacing a few words about his own advanced age he ordered Piso <a id="id_1fnm38"/>Licinianus<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn38" class="fnnum pginternal">38</a> to be sent for, either on his own initiative, or, as some believed, at the instance of Laco. Laco had met Piso at Rubellius Plautus' house and they had formed a friendship, but he cunningly pretended that he was supporting a stranger, and Piso's good repute gave colour to this policy. Piso was a noble on both sides, being the son of Marcus Crassus and Scribonia. There was an old-world austerity in his face and bearing, and just critics spoke of his strict morality: people who took a less favourable view thought him soured. But while those who disliked this side of his character carped at it, it was a recommendation in the eyes of the emperor who intended to adopt him.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap15"/><span class="chapnum">15</span>Galba is said to have taken Piso's hand and addressed him as follows: 'Were I a private citizen, and were I to adopt you in the presence of the Priests <a id="id_1page32"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="32"></a>by the usual formality of a curial statute,<a id="id_1fnm39"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn39" class="fnnum pginternal">39</a> it would be an honour for me to introduce into my family a descendant of Cnaeus Pompeius and of Marcus Crassus, and for you it would be a distinction to add to your noble ancestry the glories of the Sulpician and Lutatian <a id="id_1fnm40"/>houses.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn40" class="fnnum pginternal">40</a> As it is, I have been called by the consent of gods and men to be an emperor. Your distinguished qualities and your patriotism have persuaded me to offer to you peacefully and quietly the throne for which our ancestors fought on the field of <a id="id_1fnm41"/>battle,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn41" class="fnnum pginternal">41</a> and which I too won by war. In so doing I am following the precedent set by the sainted Augustus, who raised to the rank next himself first his nephew Marcellus, then his son-in-law Agrippa, then his daughter's sons,<a id="id_1fnm42"/><a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn42" class="fnnum pginternal">42</a> and finally his stepson Tiberius Nero. However, while Augustus looked for a successor in his own family, I have searched throughout the country. Not that I lack either kinsmen or supporters, but it was by no favour of birth that I myself came to the throne, and, to prove my policy in this matter, consider how I have passed over not only my own relatives but yours. <a id="id_1page33"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="33"></a>You have an elder <a id="id_1fnm43"/>brother,<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn43" class="fnnum pginternal">43</a> as noble as yourself. He would have been worthy of this position, but you are worthier. You are old enough to have outlived youthful passions. Your life has been such that you have nothing in your past to excuse. So far you have only experienced misfortune. Prosperity probes the heart with a keener touch; misery only calls for patience, but there is corruption in success. Honesty, candour, and affection are the best of human qualities, and doubtless you yourself have enough character to retain them. But the complaisance of others will weaken your character. Flattery and servile compliments will break down its defences and self-interest too, the bane of all sincerity. What though you and I can talk plainly with each other to-day? Others will address themselves not to us but to our fortunes. To persuade an emperor what he ought to do is a laborious task: any one can flatter him without a spark of sincerity.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap16"/><span class="chapnum">16</span>'If the vast bulk of this empire could stand and keep its balance without a guiding hand, the Republic might well have dated its birth from me. As it is, things have long ago come to such a pass that neither I in my old age can give the Roman people any better gift than a good successor, nor you in your prime anything better than a good emperor. Under Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, Rome was the heirloom of a single family. There is a kind of liberty in the free choice we have begun to exercise. Now that the <a id="id_1page34"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="34"></a>Julian and Claudian houses are extinct, by the plan of adoption the best man will always be discovered. Royal birth is the gift of fortune, and is but valued as such. In adoption we can use a free judgement, and if we wish to choose well, the voice of the country points the way. Think of Nero, swollen with the pride of his long line of royal ancestry. It was not with a powerless province at his back, nor I with a single legion that freed Rome's shoulders of that burden: it was his own cruelty and profligacy. And that was before there was any precedent for the conviction of an emperor.</p>
<p>'We have been called to the throne by the swords of those who thought us worthy. Our high state will not escape the eye of envy. You may be sure of that. But there is no reason for you to feel alarm because in this world-wide upheaval a couple of legions have not yet settled down. I myself did not succeed to a safe and peaceful throne, and, when once the news of your adoption is spread, I shall cease to be charged with my advanced age, which is now the only fault they find in me. The rascals will always miss Nero: you and I have got to see that good citizens do not miss him too.</p>
<p>'A longer sermon would ill befit the time and I have fulfilled my purpose, if I have done right in choosing you. The soundest and easiest criterion of right and wrong policy is to consider what you would have approved or condemned in another emperor. For Rome is not like the nations which are ruled by kings, <a id="id_1page35"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="35"></a>where one house is supreme and the rest are slaves. Your future subjects are men who cannot endure the extremes either of bondage or of freedom.'</p>
<p>Galba spoke these words and more to the same effect in the tone of one creating an emperor: the rest addressed Piso as though he were emperor already. <a id="Ichap17"/><span class="chapnum">17</span>He is said to have betrayed no sign of amazement or elation either before those who were then present, or later when everybody's eyes centred upon him. His language to his emperor and adoptive father was deeply respectful and he spoke modestly of himself. He made no change in his expression or bearing, showing himself more able than anxious to rule. A discussion then took place whether the adoption should be announced before the people or in the senate, or in the guards' camp. They decided in favour of the camp, on the ground that it would be a compliment to the troops, whose goodwill was hard to win by flattery or bribes, but was by no means to be despised, if it could be won by good means. Meanwhile the curiosity of the populace, impatient of any important secret, had brought together crowds all round the Palace, and when once the rumour began to leak out an attempt at suppression only resulted in spreading it.</p>
<p><a id="Ichap18"/><span class="chapnum">18</span>The tenth of January was a dreary wet day, and an extraordinary storm of thunder and lightning showed the displeasure of Providence. Such phenomena were regarded in old days as a sign for the suspension of public business, but they did not deter Galba from proceeding to the camp. Either he disregarded such <a id="id_1page36"/><a class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="36"></a>things as the result of pure chance or else he felt that the blows of fate may be foretold but not forestalled. He addressed a crowded assembly of the soldiers with true imperial brevity, stating simply that in adopting Piso he was following the example of the sainted Augustus, and the old military custom whereby each man chose <a id="id_1fnm44"/>another.<a href="1934949694085412358_16927-h-2.htm.html#id_1fn44" class="fnnum pginternal">44</a> He was afraid that by suppressing the news of the German rebellion he might only seem to exaggerate the danger, so he voluntarily declared that the Fourth and Twenty-second legions had been led by a few traitors into seditious murmurings but no further, and would soon return to their allegiance.
