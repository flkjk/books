<h3 id="id00169" style="margin-top: 3em">GERMANIA.</h3>

<p id="id00170" style="margin-top: 2em">The Treatise DE SITU, MORIBUS ET POPULIS GERMANIAE, was written (as
appears from the treatise itself see § 37) in the second consulship of
the Emperor Trajan, A.U.C. 851, A.D. 98. The design of the author in its
publication has been variously interpreted. From the censure which it
frequently passes upon the corruption and degeneracy of the times, it has
been considered as a mere satire upon Roman manners, in the age of
Tacitus. But to say nothing of the ill adaptation of the whole plan to a
satirical work, there are large parts of the treatise, which must have
been prepared with great labor, and yet can have no possible bearing on
such a design. Satires are not wont to abound in historical notices and
geographical details, especially touching a foreign and distant land.</p>

<p id="id00171">The same objection lies against the <i>political</i> ends, which have been
imputed to the author, such as the persuading of Trajan to engage, or
<i>not</i> to engage, in a war with the Germans, as the most potent and
dangerous enemy of Rome. For both these aims have been alleged, and we
might content ourselves with placing the one as an offset against the
other. But aside from the neutralizing force of such contradictions,
wherefore such an imposing array of geographical research, of historical
lore, of political and moral philosophy, for the accomplishment of so
simple a purpose? And why is the purpose so scrupulously concealed, that
confessedly it can be gathered only from obscure intimations, and those
of ambiguous import? Besides, there are passages whose tendency must have
been directly counter to either of these alleged aims (cf. note § 33).
The author does indeed, in the passage just cited, seem to appreciate
with almost prophetic accuracy, those dangers to the Roman Empire, which
were so fearfully illustrated in its subsequent fall beneath the power of
the German Tribes; and he utters, as what true Roman would not in such
forebodings, the warnings and the prayers of a patriot sage. But he does
this only in episodes, which are so manifestly incidental, and yet arise
so naturally out of the narrative or description, that it is truly
surprising it should ever have occurred to any reader, to seek in them
the key to the whole treatise.</p>

<p id="id00172">The entire warp and woof of the work is obviously <i>historical</i> and
<i>geographical</i>. The satire, the political maxims, the moral sentiments,
and all the rest, are merely incidental, interwoven for the sake of
instruction and embellishment, inwrought because a mind so thoughtful and
so acute as that of Tacitus, could not leave them out. Tacitus had long
been collecting the materials for his Roman Histories. In so doing, his
attention was necessarily drawn often and with special interest to a
people, who, for two centuries and more, had been the most formidable
enemy of the Roman State. In introducing them into his history, he would
naturally wish to give some preliminary account of their origin, manners,
and institutions, as he does in introducing the Jews in the Fifth Book of
his Histories, which happens to be, in part, preserved. Nor would it be
strange, if he should, with this view, collect a mass of materials, which
he could not incorporate entire into a work of such compass, and which
any slight occasion might induce him to publish in a separate form,
perhaps as a sort of forerunner to his Histories. [It has even been
argued by highly respectable scholars, that the Germania of Tacitus is
itself only such a collection of materials, not published by the Author,
and never intended for publication in that form. But it is quite too
methodical, too studied, and too finished a work to admit of that
supposition (cf. Prolegom. of K.).] Such an occasion now was furnished
in the campaigns and victories of Trajan, who, at the time of his
elevation to the imperial power, was at the head of the Roman armies in
Germany, where he also remained for a year or more after his accession to
the throne, till he had received the submission of the hostile tribes and
wiped away the disgrace which the Germans, beyond any other nation of
that age, had brought upon the Roman arms. Such a people, at such a time,
could not fail to be an object of deep interest at Rome. This was the
time when Tacitus published his work on Germany; and such are believed
to have been the motives and the circumstances, which led to the
undertaking. His grand object was not to point a satire or to compass a
political end, but as he himself informs us (§ 27), to treat of the
origin and manners, the geography and history, of the German Tribes.</p>

<p id="id00173">The same candor and sincerity, the same correctness and truthfulness,
which characterize the Histories, mark also the work on Germany. The
author certainly aimed to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth, on
the subject of which he treats. Moreover, he had abundant means of
knowing the truth, on all the main points, in the character and history
of the Germans. It has even been argued from such expression as <i>vidimus</i>
(§ 8), that Tacitus had himself been in Germany, and could, therefore,
write from personal observation. Bnt the argument proceeds on a
misinterpretation of his language (cf. note in <i>loc. cit</i>.). And the use
of <i>accepimus</i> (as in § 27), shows that he derived his information from
others. But the Romans had been in constant intercourse and connection,
civil or military, with the Germans, for two hundred years. Germany
furnished a wide theatre for their greatest commanders, and a fruitful
theme for their best authors, some of whom, as Julius Caesar (to whom
Tacitus particularly refers, 28), were themselves the chief actors in
what they relate. These authors, some of whose contributions to the
history of Germany are now lost (e.g. the elder Pliny, who wrote twenty
books on the German wars), must have all been in the hands of Tacitus,
and were, doubtless, consulted by him; not, however, as a servile
copyist, or mere compiler (for he sometimes differs from his authorities,
from Caesar even, whom he declares to be the best of them), but as a
discriminating and judicious inquirer. The account of German customs and
institutions may, therefore, be relied on, from the intrinsic credibility
of the author. It receives confirmation, also, from its general
accordance with other early accounts of the Germans, and with their
better known subsequent history, as well as from its strong analogy to
the well-known habits of our American aborigines, and other tribes in a
like stage of civilization (cf. note, § 15). The geographical details are
composed with all the accuracy which the ever-shifting positions and
relations of warring and wandering tribes rendered possible in the nature
of the case (cf. note, § 28). In sentiment, the treatise is surpassingly
rich and instructive, like all the works of this prince of philosophical
historians. In style, it is concise and nervous, yet quite rhetorical,
and in parts, even poetical to a fault (see notes passim, cf. also,
Monboddo's critique on the style of Tacitus). "The work," says La
Bletterie, "is brief without being superficial. Within the compass of a
few pages, it comprises more of ethics and politics, more fine
delineations of character, more substance and pith (<i>suc</i>), than can be
collected from many a ponderous volume. It is not one of those barely
agreeable descriptions, which gradually diffuse their influence over
the soul, and leave it in undisturbed tranquillity. It is a picture in
strong light, like the subject itself, full of fire, of sentiment, of
lightning-flashes, that go at once to the heart. We imagine ourselves
in Germany; we become familiar with these so-called barbarians; we pardon
their faults, and almost their vices, out of regard to their virtues; and
in our moments of enthusiasm, we even wish we were Germans."</p>

<p id="id00174">The following remarks of Murphy will illustrate the value of the
treatise, to modern Europeans and their descendants. "It is a draught of
savage manners, delineated by a masterly hand; the more interesting, as
the part of the world which it describes was the seminary of the modern
European nations, the VAGINA GENTIUM, as historians have emphatically
called it. The work is short but, as Montesquieu observes, it is the work
of a man who abridged every thing, because he knew every thing. A
thorough knowledge of the transactions of barbarous ages, will throw more
light than is generally imagined on the laws of modern times. Wherever
the barbarians, who issued from their northern hive, settled in new
habitations, they carried with them their native genius, their original
manners, and the first rudiments of the political system which has
prevailed in different parts of Europe. They established monarchy and
liberty, subordination and freedom, the prerogative of the prince and the
rights of the subject, all united in so bold a combination, that the
fabric, in some places, stands to this hour the wonder of mankind. The
British constitution, says Montesquieu, came out of the woods of Germany.
What the state of this country (Britain) was before the arrival of our
Saxon ancestors, Tacitus has shown in the life of Agricola. If we add to
his account of the Germans and Britons, what has been transmitted to us,
concerning them, by Julius Caesar, we shall see the origin of the
Anglo-Saxon government, the great outline of that Gothic constitution
under which the people enjoy their rights and liberties at this hour.
Montesquieu, speaking of his own country, declares it impossible to form
an adequate notion of the French monarchy, and the changes of their
government, without a previous inquiry into the manners, genius, and
spirit of the German nations. Much of what was incorporated with the
institutions of those fierce invaders, has flowed down in the stream of
time, and still mingles with our modern jurisprudence. The subject, it is
conceived, is interesting to every Briton. In the manners of the Germans,
the reader will see our present frame of government, as it were, in its
cradle, <i>gentis cunabula nostrae</i>! in the Germans themselves, a fierce
and warlike people, to whom this country owes that spirit of liberty,
which, through so many centuries, has preserved our excellent form of
government, and raised the glory of the British nation:</p>

</p>

<p id="id00176" style="margin-top: 2em">CHAP. I. <i>Germania</i> stands first as the emphatic word, and is followed by
<i>omnis</i> for explanation. <i>Germania omnis</i> here does not include Germania
Prima and Secunda, which were Roman provinces on the left bank of the
Rhine (so called because settled by Germans). It denotes <i>Germany
proper</i>, as a <i>whole</i>, in distinction from the provinces just mentioned
and from the several tribes, of which Tacitus treats in the latter part
of the work. So Caesar (B.G. 1,1) uses <i>Gallia omnis</i>, as exclusive of
the Roman provinces called Gaul and inclusive of the three <i>parts</i>, which
he proceeds to specify.</p>

<p id="id00177"><i>Gallis—Pannoniis</i>. People used for the countries. Cf. His. 5,6:
<i>Phoenices. Gaul</i>, now France; <i>Rhaetia</i>, the country of the Grisons and
the Tyrol, with part of Bavaria; <i>Pannonia</i>, lower Hungary and part of
Austria. Germany was separated from Gaul by the Rhine; from Rhaetia and
Pannonia, by the Danube.—<i>Rheno et Danubio</i>. Rhine and Rhone are
probably different forms of the same root (Rh-n). Danube, in like manner,
has the same root as Dnieper (Dn-p); perhaps also the same as Don and
Dwina (D-n). Probably each of these roots was originally a generic name
for river, water, stream. So there are several <i>Avons</i> in England and
Scotland. Cf. Latham's Germania sub voc.</p>

<p id="id00178"><i>Sarmatis Dacisque</i>. The Slavonic Tribes were called Sarmatians by the
ancients. <i>Sarmatia</i> included the country north of the Carpathian
Mountains, between the Vistula and the Don in Europe, together with the
adjacent part of Asia, without any definite limits towards the north,
which was terra incognita to the ancients—in short, Sarmatia was
<i>Russia</i>, as far as known at that time. <i>Dacia</i> lay between the
Carpathian mountains on the north, and the Danube on the south, including
Upper Hungary, Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia.</p>

<p id="id00179"><i>Mutuo metu</i>. Rather a poetical boundary! Observe also the alliteration.
At the same time, the words are not a bad description of those wide and
solitary wastes, which, as Caesar informs us (B.G. 6, 23), the Germans
delighted to interpose between themselves and other nations, so that it
might appear that <i>no one dared to dwell near them.—Montibus</i>. The
Carpathian.—<i>Cetera</i>. Ceteram Germaniae partem.</p>

<p id="id00180"><i>Sinus</i>. This word denotes any thing with a curved outline (cf. 29, also
A. 23); hence bays, peninsulas, and prominent bends or borders, whether
of land or water. Here <i>peninsulas</i> (particularly that of Jutland, now
Denmark), for it is to the author's purpose here to speak of land rather
than water, and the ocean is more properly said to <i>embrace peninsulas</i>,
than <i>gulfs</i> and <i>bays</i>. Its association with <i>islands</i> here favors the
same interpretation. So Passow, Or., Rit. Others, with less propriety,
refer it to the <i>gulfs</i> and <i>bays</i>, which so mark the Baltic and the
German Oceans.—<i>Oceanus</i> here, includes both the Baltic Sea, and the
German Ocean (Oceanus Septentrionalis).</p>

<p id="id00181"><i>Insularum—spatia. Islands of vast extent</i>, viz. Funen, Zealand, &amp;c.
Scandinavia also (now Sweden and Norway) was regarded by the ancients as
an island, cf. Plin. Nat. His. iv. 27: quarum (insularum) clarissima
Scandinavia est, incompertae magnitudinis.</p>

<p id="id00182"><i>Nuper—regibus</i>. Understand with this clause <i>ut compertum est</i>. The
above mentioned features of the Northern Ocean had been <i>discovered</i>
in the prosecution of the late wars, of the Romans, among the tribes
and kings previously unknown. <i>Nuper</i> is to be taken in a general
sense==recentioribus temporibus, cf. <i>nuper additum</i>, § 2, where it goes
back one hundred and fifty years to the age of Julius Caesar.—<i>Bellum</i>.
War in general, no particular war.—<i>Versus</i>. This word has been
considered by some as an adverb, and by others as a preposition. It is
better however to regard it as a participle, like <i>ortus</i>, with which it
is connected, though without a conjunction expressed. Ritter omits <i>in</i>.</p>

<p id="id00183"><i>Molli et clementer edito. Of gentle slope and moderate elevation</i> in
studied antithesis to <i>inaccesso ac praecipiti, lofty and steep</i>. In like
manner, <i>jugo, ridge, summit</i>, is contrasted with <i>vertice, peak,
height</i>, cf. Virg. Ecl. 9, 7: <i>molli clivo</i>; Ann. 17, 38: <i>colles
clementer assurgentes</i>. The <i>Rhaetian</i> Alps, now the mountains of the
Grisons. <i>Alp</i> is a Celtic word==hill. <i>Albion</i> has the same root==<i>hilly
country. Mons Abnoba</i> (al. Arnoba) is the northern part of the
Schwartzwald, or Black Forest.—<i>Erumpat</i>, al. erumpit. But the best MSS.
and all the recent editions have <i>erumpat</i>: and Tacitus never uses the
pres. ind. after <i>donec, until</i>, cf. Rup. &amp; Rit. in loc. Whenever he uses
the present after <i>donec, until</i>, he seems to have conceived the relation
of the two clauses, which it connects, as that of a means to an end, or a
condition to a result, and hence to have used the subj. cf. chap. 20:
<i>separet</i>; 31: <i>absolvat</i>; 35: <i>sinuetur</i>; Ann. 2, 6: <i>misceatur</i>. The
two examples last cited, like this, describe the course of a river and
boundary line. For the general rule of the modes after <i>donec</i>, see H.
522; Z. 575. See also notes H. 1, 13. 35.—<i>Septimum</i>. According to the
common understanding, the Danube had <i>seven</i> mouths. So Strabo, Mela,
Ammian, and Ovid; Pliny makes six. T. reconciles the two accounts. The
<i>enim</i> inserted after <i>septimum</i> in most editions is not found in the
best mss. and is unnecessary. Or. &amp; Rit. omit it.</p>

<p id="id00184" style="margin-top: 2em"> II. <i>Ipsos</i> marks the transition from the country to the people—<i>the<br/>

Germans themselves</i>. So A. 13: <i>Ipsi Britanni</i>.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00185"><i>Crediderim</i>. Subj. attice. A modest way of expressing his opinion, like
our: I should say, I am inclined to think. H. 486, I. 3; Z. 527.</p>

<p id="id00186"><i>Adventibus et hospitiis. Immigrants and visitors. Adventibus</i> certae
sedes, <i>hospitiis</i> preregrinationes significantur. Gün. Both abstract for
concrete. Död. compares [Greek: epoikoi] and [Greek: metoikoi].</p>

<p id="id00187"><i>Terra—advehebantur</i>. Zeugma for <i>terra adveniebant</i>, classibus
advehebantur. H. 704, I. 2; Z. 775.</p>

<p id="id00188"><i>Nec—et</i>. These correlatives connect the members more closely than
et—et; as in Greek oute-te. The sentiment here advanced touching
colonization (as by sea, rather than by land), though true of Carthage,
Sicily, and most <i>Grecian</i>, colonies, is directly the reverse of the
general fact; and Germany itself is now known to have received its
population by land emigration, from western Asia. The Germans, as we
learn from affinities of languages and occasional references of
historians and geographers, belonged to the same great stock of the human
family with the Goths and Scythians, and may be traced back to that hive
of nations, that primitive residence of mankind, the country east and
south of the Caspian Sea and in the vicinity of Mount Ararat: cf. Tur.
His. Ang. Sax. B. II. C. 1; also Donaldson's New Cratylus, B. I. Chap. 4.
Latham's dogmatic skepticism will hardly shake the now established faith
on this subject. The science of ethnography was unknown to the ancients.
Tacitus had not the remotest idea, that all mankind were sprung from a
common ancestry, and diffused themselves over the world from a common
centre, a fact asserted in the Scriptures, and daily receiving fresh
confirmation from literature and science. Hence he speaks of the Germans
as <i>indigenas</i>, which he explains below by <i>editum terra</i>, sprung from
the earth, like the mutum et turpe pecus of Hor. Sat. 1. 3, 100. cf.
A. 11.</p>

<p id="id00189"><i>Mutare quaerebant. Quaerere</i> with inf. is poet. constr., found, however,
in later prose writers, and once in Cic. (de Fin. 313: quaeris scire,
enclosed in brackets in Tauchnitz's edition), to avoid repetition of
<i>cupio</i>. <i>Cupio</i> or <i>volo mutare</i> would be regular classic prose.</p>

<p id="id00190"><i>Adversus</i>. That the author here uses <i>adversus</i> in some unusual and
recondite sense, is intimated by the clause: <i>ut sic dixerim</i>. It is
understood by some, of a sea <i>unfriendly to navigation</i>. But its
connexion by <i>que</i> with <i>immensus ultra</i>, shows that it refers to
<i>position</i>, and means <i>lying opposite</i>, i.e., belonging, as it were, to
another hemisphere or world from ours; for so the Romans regarded the
Northern Ocean and Britain itself, cf. A 12: ultra <i>nostri orbis</i>
mensuram; G. 17: <i>exterior</i> oceanus. So Cic. (Som. Scip. 6.) says:
Homines partim obliquos, partim aversos, partim etiam <i>adversos</i>, stare
vobis. This interpretation is confirmed by <i>ab orbe nostra</i> in the
antithesis. On the use of <i>ut sic dixerim</i> for <i>ut sic dicam</i>, which is
peculiar to the silver age, see Z. 528.</p>
  
  <p id="id00191"><i>Asia</i>, sc. Minor. <i>Africa</i>, sc. the Roman Province of that name,
comprising the territory of Carthage.—<i>Peteret</i>. The question implies a
negative answer, cf. Z. 530. The subj. implies a protasis understood: if
he could, or the like. H. 502.</p>

<p id="id00192"><i>Sit</i>. Praesens, ut de re vera. Gün. <i>Nisi si</i> is nearly equivalent to
<i>nisi forte: unless perchance</i>; unless if we may suppose the case. Cf.
Wr. note on Ann. 2, 63, and Hand's Tursellinus, 3, 240.</p>

<p id="id00193"><i>Memoriae et annalium</i>. Properly opposed to each other as <i>tradition</i> and
<i>written history</i>, though we are not to infer that written books existed
in Germany in the age of Tacitus.</p>

<p id="id00194"><i>Carminibus</i>. <i>Songs, ballads</i> (from cano). Songs and rude poetry have
been, in all savage countries, the memorials of public transactions,
e.g. the runes of the Goths, the bards of the Britons and Celts, the
scalds of Scandinavia, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id00195"><i>Tuisconem</i>. The god from whom Tuesday takes its name, as Wednesday from
Woden, Thursday from Thor, &amp;c., cf. Sharon Turner's His. of Ang. Sax.
app. to book 2. chap. 3. Some find in the name of this god the root of
the words Teutonic, Dutch (Germ. Deutsche or Teutsche &amp;c.,) Al. Tuistonem,
Tristonem, &amp;c. More likely it has the same root as the Latin divus,
dius, deus, and the Greek theios, dios, theos, cf. Grimm's <i>Deutsche
Mythologie</i>, sub v.</p>

<p id="id00196"><i>Terra editum==indigena</i> above; and gaegenaes and autochthon in Greek.</p>

<p id="id00197"><i>Originem</i>==auctores. It is predicate after <i>Mannum</i>.</p>

<p id="id00198"><i>Ut in licentia vetustatis. As in the license of antiquity</i>, i.e. since
such license is allowed in regard to ancient times.</p>

<p id="id00199"><i>Ingaevones</i>. "According to some German antiquaries, the <i>Ingaevones</i> are
die <i>Einwohner</i>, those dwelling inwards towards the sea; the <i>Istaevones</i>
are die <i>Westwohner</i>, the inhabitants of the western parts; and the
<i>Hermiones</i> are the <i>Herumwohner</i>, midland inhabitants," Ky. cf.
Kiessling in loc. Others, e.g. Zeuss and Grimm, with more probability,
find in these names the roots of German words significant of <i>honor</i>
and <i>bravery</i>, assumed by different tribes or confederacies as epithets
or titles of distinction. Grimm identifies these three divisions with
the Franks, Saxons, and Thuringians of a later age. See further, note
chap. 27.</p>

<p id="id00200"><i>Vocentur</i>. The subj. expresses the opinion of others, not the direct
affirmation of the author. H. 529; Z. 549.</p>

<p id="id00201"><i>Deo</i>==hoc deo, sc. Mannus—Germ. Mann, Eng. Man.</p>

<p id="id00202"><i>Marsos, Gambrivios</i>. Under the names of Franci and Salii these tribes
afterwards became formidable to the Romans. Cf. Prichard's Researches
into the Physical History of Mankind, Vol. III. chap. 6, sec. 2.—
<i>Suevos</i>, cf. note, 38.—<i>Vandalios</i>. The Vandals, now so familiar in
history.</p>

<p id="id00203"><i>Additum</i>, sc. esse, depending on <i>affirmant</i>.</p>

<p id="id00204"><i>Nunc Tungri</i>, sc. vocentur, cf. His. 4, 15, 16. In confirmation of the
historical accuracy of this passage, Gr. remarks, that Caes. (B.G. 2, 4)
does not mention the Tungri, but names four tribes on the left bank of
the Rhine, who, he says, are called by the common name of <i>Germans</i>;
while Pliny (Nat. His. 4, 31), a century later, gives not the names of
these four tribes, but calls them by the new name <i>Tungri</i>.</p>

<p id="id00205"><i>Ita—vocarentur</i>. Locus vexatissimus! exclaim all the critics. And so
they set themselves to amend the text by conjecture. Some have written
<i>in nomen gentis</i> instead of <i>non gentis</i>. Others have proposed <i>a
victorum metu</i>, or <i>a victo ob metum</i>, or <i>a victis ob metum</i>. But these
emendations are wholly conjectural and unnecessary. Günther and Walch
render <i>a victore, from</i> the victorious tribe, i.e. <i>after the name of</i>
that tribe. But <i>a se ipsis</i> means <i>by</i> themselves; and the antithesis
doubtless requires <i>a</i> to be understood in the same sense in both
clauses. Grüber translates and explains thus: "In this way the name of a
single tribe, and not of the whole people, has come into use, so that
all, at first by the victor (the Tungri), in order to inspire fear, then
by themselves (by the mouth of the whole people), when once the name
became known, were called by the name of Germans. That is, the Tungri
called all the kindred tribes that dwelt beyond the Rhine, Germans, in
order to inspire fear by the wide extension of the name, since they gave
themselves out to be a part of so vast a people; but at length all the
tribes began to call themselves by this name, probably because they were
pleased to see the fear which it excited." This is, on the whole, the
most satisfactory explanation of the passage, and meets the essential
concurrence of Wr., Or. and Död.—<i>Germani</i>. If of German etymology,
this word==gehr or wehr (Fr. guerre) and mann, <i>men of war</i>; hence the
<i>metus</i>, which the name carried with it. If it is a Latin word
corresponding only in <i>sense</i> with the original German, then==<i>brethren</i>.
It will be seen, that either etymology would accord with Grüber's
explanation of the whole passage—in either case, the name would
inspire fear. The latter, however, is the more probable, cf. Ritter in
loc. A people often bear quite different names abroad from that by which
they call themselves at home. Thus the people, whom we call <i>Germans</i>,
call themselves <i>Deutsche</i> (Dutch), and are called by the French
<i>Allemands</i>, cf. Latham. <i>Vocarentur</i> is subj. because it stands in a
subordinate clause of the oratio obliqua, cf. H. 531; Z. 603.</p>

<p id="id00206"><i>Metum</i>. Here taken in an <i>active</i> sense; oftener passive, but used in
both senses. Quintilian speaks of <i>metum duplicem</i>, quem patimur et quem
facimus (6, 2, 21). cf. A. 44: nihil metus in vultu, i.e., nothing to
inspire fear in his countenance. In like manner admiratio (§ 7) is used
for the admiration which one excites, though it usually denotes the
admiration which one feels. For <i>ob</i>, cf. Ann. 1, 79: <i>ob moderandas
Tiberis exundationes</i>.</p>

<p id="id00207"><i>Nationis—gentis. Gens</i> is often used by T. as a synonym with <i>natio</i>.
But in antithesis, <i>gens</i> is the whole, of which <i>nationes</i> or <i>populi</i>
are the parts, e.g. G. 4: populos—gentem; § 14: nationes—genti. In
like manner, in the civil constitution of Rome, a <i>gens</i> included several
related <i>families</i>.</p>

<p id="id00208" style="margin-top: 2em">III. <i>Herculem</i>. That is, Romana interpretatione, cf. § 34. The Romans
found <i>their</i> gods everywhere, and ascribed to Hercules, quidquid ubique
magnificum est, cf. note 34: <i>quicquid—consensimus</i>. That this is a
Roman account of the matter is evident, from the use of <i>eos</i>, for if
the Germans were the subject of <i>memorant</i>, <i>se</i> must have been used. On
the use of <i>et</i> here, cf. note 11.</p>

<p id="id00209"><i>Primum</i>—ut principem, fortissimum. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00210"><i>Haec quoque</i>. <i>Haec</i> is rendered <i>such</i> by Ritter. But it seems rather,
as Or. and Död. explain it, to imply nearness and familiarity to the mind
of the author and his readers: <i>these</i> well known songs. So 20: <i>in haec
corpora, quae miramur</i>. <i>Quoque</i>, like <i>quidem</i>, follows the emphatic
word in a clause, H. 602, III. 1; Z. 355.</p>

<p id="id00211"><i>Relatu</i>, called <i>cantus trux</i>, H. 2, 22. A Tacitean word. Freund. Cf. H.
1, 30.</p>

<p id="id00212"><i>Baritum</i>. Al. barditum and barritum. But the latter has no ms.
authority, and the former seems to have been suggested by the bards of
the Gauls, of whose existence among the Germans however there is no
evidence. Död. says the root of the word is common to the Greek, Latin,
and German languages, viz. <i>baren</i>, i.e. <i>fremere</i>, a verb still used by
the Batavians, and the noun <i>bar</i>, i.e. carmen, of frequent occurrence
in Saxon poetry to this day.</p>

<p id="id00213"><i>Terrent trepidantve. They inspire terror or tremble with fear, according
as the line</i> (the troops drawn up in battle array) <i>has sounded</i>, sc. the
<i>baritus</i> or battle cry. Thus the Batavians perceived, that the <i>sonitus
aciei</i> on the part of the Romans was more feeble than their own, and
pressed on, as to certain triumph. H. 4, 18. So the Highlanders augured
victory, if their shouts were louder than those of the enemy. See Murphy
in loco.</p>

<p id="id00214"><i>Repercussu</i>. A post-Augustan word. The earlier Latin authors would have
said <i>repercussa</i>, or <i>repercutiendo</i>. The later Latin, like the English,
uses more abstract terms.—<i>Nec tam—videntur. Nor do those carmina seem
to be so much voices</i> (well modulated and harmonized), <i>as acclamations</i>
(unanimous, but inarticulate and indistinct) <i>of courage</i>. So Pliny uses
<i>concentus</i> of the acclamations of the people. Panegyr. 2. It is often
applied by the poets to the concerts of birds, as in Virg. Geor. 1, 422.
It is here plural, cf. Or. in loc. The reading <i>vocis</i> is without MS.
authority.</p>

<p id="id00215"><i>Ulixem</i>. "The love of fabulous history, which was the passion of ancient
times, produced a new Hercules in every country, and made Ulysses wander
on every shore. Tacitus mentions it as a romantic tale; but Strabo seems
willing to countenance the fiction, and gravely tells us that Ulysses
founded a city, called Odyssey, in Spain. Lipsius observes, that Lisbon,
in the name of Strabo, had the appellation of Ulysippo, or Olisipo. At
this rate, he pleasantly adds, what should hinder us inhabitants of the
Low Countries from asserting that Ulysses built the city of Ulyssinga,
and Circe founded that of Circzea or Ziriczee?" Murphy.</p>

<p id="id00216"><i>Fabuloso errore. Storied, celebrated in song</i>, cf. fabulosus Hydaspes.
Hor. Od. 1, 227. Ulysses having <i>wandered westward</i> gave plausibility to
alleged traces of him in Gaul, Spain and Germany—<i>Asciburgium</i>. Now
Asburg.</p>

<p id="id00217"><i>Quin etiam</i>, cf. notes, 13: <i>quin etiam</i>, and 14: <i>quin immo.—Ulixi</i>,
i.e. ab Ulixe, cf. Ann. 15,41: Aedes statoris Jovis Romulo vota, i.e. by
Romulus. This usage is especially frequent in the poets and the later
prose writers, cf. H. 388, II. 3; Z. 419; and in T. above all others, cf.
Böt. Lex. Tac. sub <i>Dativus</i>. Wr. and Rit. understand however an altar
(or monument) consecrated to Ulysses, i.e. erected in honor of him by the
citizens.</p>

<p id="id00218"><i>Adjecto</i>. Inscribed with the name of his father, as well as his own,
i.e. [Greek: Laertiadae].</p>

<p id="id00219"><i>Graecis litteris. Grecian characters</i>, cf. Caes. B.G. 1, 29: In castris
<i>Helvetiorum</i>, tabulae repertae sunt <i>litteris Graecis</i> confectae; and
(6, 14): <i>Galli</i> in publicis privatisque rationibus <i>Graecis utuntur
litteris</i>. T. speaks (Ann. 11, 14) of alphabetic characters, as passing
from Phenicia into Greece, and Strabo (4, 1) traces them from the Grecian
colony at Marseilles, into Gaul, whence they doubtless passed into
Germany, and even into Britain.</p>

<p id="id00220" style="margin-top: 2em">IV. <i>Aliis aliarum</i>. The Greek and Latin are both fond of a repetition
of different cases of the same word, even where one of them is redundant,
e.g. [Greek: oioden oios] (Hom. II. 7, 39), and particularly in the
words [Greek: allos] and <i>alius</i>. <i>Aliis</i> is not however wholly
redundant; but brings out more fully the idea: <i>no intermarriages, one
with one nation, and another with another</i>. Walch and Ritter omit
<i>aliis</i>, though it is found in all the MSS.</p>

<p id="id00221"><i>Infectos</i>. Things are said <i>infici</i> and <i>imbui</i>, which are so penetrated
and permeated by something else, that that something becomes a part of
its nature or substance, as inficere colore, sanguine, veneno, animum
virtutibus. It does not necessarily imply corruption or degeneracy.</p>

<p id="id00222"><i>Propriam—similem</i>. Three epithets not essentially different used for
the sake of emphasis==<i>peculiar, pure, and sui-generis. Similis</i> takes
the gen., when it expresses, as here, an internal resemblance in
character; otherwise the dat., cf. Z. 411, H. 391, 2. 4.</p>

<p id="id00223"><i>Habitus</i>. Form and features, external appearance. The physical features
of the Germans as described by Tacitus, though still sufficient to
distinguish them from the more southern European nations, have proved
less permanent than their mental and social characteristics.</p>

<p id="id00224"><i>Idem omnibus</i>. Cf. Juv. 13, 164:</p>

<p id="id00225">    <i>Caerula</i> quis stupuit <i>Germani lumina? flavam<br/>

    Caesariem</i>, et madido torquentem cornua cirro?<br/>

    Nempe quod haec illis natura est <i>omnibus una</i>.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00226"><i>Magna corpora</i>. "Sidonius Apollinaris says, that, being in Germany and
finding the men so very tall, he could not address verses of six feet to
patrons who were seven feet high:</p>

<p id="id00227">    Spernit senipedem stilum Thalia,<br/>

    Ex quo septipedes vidit patronos."    Mur.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00228">Skeletons, in the ancient graves of Germany, are found to vary from 5 ft.
10 in. to 6 ft. 10 in. and even 7 ft. Cf. Ukert, Geog. III. 1. p. 197.
These skeletons indicate a <i>strong</i> and <i>well formed</i> body.</p>

<p id="id00229"><i>Impetum. Temporary exertion</i>, as opposed to <i>persevering toil and
effort, laboris atque operum</i>.</p>

<p id="id00230"><i>Eadem</i>. Not so much <i>patientia</i>, as <i>ad impetum valida</i>. See a like
elliptical use of <i>idem</i> § 23: eadem temperantia; § 10: iisdem nemoribus.
Also of totidem § 26.</p>

<p id="id00231"><i>Minime—assueverunt</i>. "Least of all, are they capable of sustaining
thirst and heat; cold and hunger, they are accustomed, by their soil and
climate, to endure." Ky. The force of <i>minime</i> is confined to the first
clause, and the proper antithetic particle is omitted at the beginning of
the second. <i>Tolerare</i> depends on <i>assueverunt</i>, and belongs to both
clauses. <i>Ve</i> is distributive, referring <i>coelo</i> to <i>frigora</i> and <i>solo</i>
to <i>inediam</i>. So <i>vel</i> in H. 1, 62: strenuis <i>vel</i> ignavis spem metumque
addere==strenuis spem, ignavis metum addere.</p>

<p id="id00232" style="margin-top: 2em">V. <i>Humidior—ventosior. Humidior</i> refers to <i>paludibus, ventosior</i> to
<i>silvis</i>; the mountains (which were exposed to sweeping <i>winds</i>) being
for the most part covered with forests, and the low grounds with marshes.
<i>Ventosus</i>==Homeric [Greek: aenemoeis], windy, i.e. lofty. H. 3, 305:
[Greek: Ilion aenemoessan].</p>

<p id="id00233"><i>Satis ferax. Satis==segetibus</i> poetice. <i>Ferax</i> is constructed with
abl., vid. Virg. Geor. 2, 222: ferax oleo.</p>

<p id="id00234"><i>Impatiens</i>. Not to be taken in the absolute sense, cf. § 20, 23, 26,
where fruit trees and fruits are spoken of.</p>

<p id="id00235"><i>Improcera</i> agrees with <i>pecora</i> understood.</p>

<p id="id00236"><i>Armentis. Pecora</i>—flocks in general. <i>Armenta</i> (from <i>aro</i>, to plough),
larger cattle in particular. It <i>may</i> include horses.</p>

<p id="id00237"><i>Suus honor</i>. Their proper, i.e. usual size and beauty.</p>

<p id="id00238"><i>Gloria frontis</i>. Poetice for <i>cornua</i>. Their horns were small.</p>

<p id="id00239"><i>Numero</i>. Emphatic: <i>number</i>, rather than <i>quality</i>. Or, with Ritter,
<i>gaudent</i> may be taken in the sense of enjoy, possess: <i>they have a good
number of them</i>. In the same sense he interprets <i>gaudent</i> in A. 44:
<i>opibus nimiis non gaudebat</i>.</p>

<p id="id00240"><i>Irati</i>, sc. quia <i>opes</i> sunt <i>irritamenta malorum</i>. Ov. Met. 1, 140.—
<i>Negaverint</i>. Subj. H. 525; Z. 552—<i>Affirmaverim</i>. cf. note, 2:
<i>crediderim</i>.</p>

<p id="id00241"><i>Nullam venam</i>. "Mines of gold and silver have since been discovered in
Germany; the former, indeed, inconsiderable, but the latter valuable."
Ky. T. himself in his later work (the Annals), speaks of the discovery of
a silver mine in Germany. Ann. 11, 20.</p>

<p id="id00242"><i>Perinde. Not so much as might be expected</i>, or as the <i>Romans</i>, and
other civilized nations. So Gronovius, Död. and most commentators. See
Rup. in loc. Others, as Or. and Rit. allow no ellipsis, and render: <i>not
much</i>. See Hand's Tursellinus, vol. IV. p. 454. We sometimes use <i>not so
much, not so very, not so bad</i>, &amp;c., for <i>not very, not much</i>, and <i>not
bad</i>. Still the form of expression strictly implies a comparison. And the
same is true of <i>haud perinde</i>, cf. Böt. Lex. Tac.</p>

<p id="id00243"><i>Est videre. Est</i> for <i>licet</i>. Graece et poetice. Not so used in the
earlier Latin prose. See Z. 227.</p>

<p id="id00244"><i>Non in alia vilitate</i>, i.e. eadem vilitate, aeque vilia, <i>held in the
same low estimation.—Humo</i>. Abl. of material.</p>

<p id="id00245"><i>Proximi</i>, sc. ad ripam. Nearest to the Roman border, opposed to
<i>interiores</i>.</p>

<p id="id00246"><i>Serratos</i>. Not elsewhere mentioned; probably coins with serrated edges,
still found. The word is post-Augustan.</p>

<p id="id00247"><i>Bigatos</i>. Roman coins stamped with a biga or two-horse chariot. Others
were stamped with a quadriga and called quadrigati. The bigati seem to
have circulated freely in foreign lands, cf. Ukert's Geog. of Greeks and
Romans, III. 1: Trade of Germany, and places cited there. "The serrati
and bigati were old coins, of purer silver than those of tho Emperors."
Ky. Cf. Pliny, H. N. 33, 13.</p>

<p id="id00248"><i>Sequuntur</i>. Sequi==expetere. So used by Cic., Sal., and the best
writers. Compare our word <i>seek</i>.</p>

<p id="id00249"><i>Nulla affectione animi. Not from any partiality for the silver in
itself</i> (but for convenience).</p>

<p id="id00250"><i>Numerus</i>. Greater number and consequently less relative value of the
silver coins. On <i>quia</i>, cf. note, H. 1, 31.</p>

<p id="id00251" style="margin-top: 2em">VI. <i>Ne—quidem</i>. <i>Not even</i>, i.e. iron is scarce as well as gold and
silver. The weapons found in ancient German graves are of <i>stone</i>, and
bear a striking resemblance to those of the American Indians. Cf. Ukert,
p. 216. Ad verba, cf. note, His. 1, 16: <i>ne—fueris</i>. The emphatic word
always stands between <i>ne</i> and <i>quidem</i>. H. 602, III. 2; Z. 801.—
<i>Superest</i>. Is over and above, i.e. <i>abounds</i>. So superest ager, § 26.</p>

<p id="id00252"><i>Vel</i>. Pro <i>sive</i>, Ciceroni inauditum. Gün. Cf. note, 17.</p>

<p id="id00253"><i>Frameas</i>. The word is still found in Spain, as well as Germany.
<i>Lancea</i>. is also a Spanish word, cf. Freund.</p>

<p id="id00254"><i>Nudi</i>. Cf. § 17, 20, and 24. Also Caes., B.G. 6, 21: magna corporis
parte nuda.</p>

<p id="id00255"><i>Sagulo</i>. Dim. of sago. A small short cloak.—<i>Leves</i>==Leviter induti.
The clause <i>nudi—leves</i> is added <i>here</i> to show, that their dress is
favorable to the use of missiles.</p>

<p id="id00256"><i>Missilia spargunt</i>. Dictio est Virgiliana. K.</p>

<p id="id00257"><i>Coloribus</i>. Cf. nigra scuta, § 43. "Hence coats of arms and the origin
of heraldry." Mur.</p>

<p id="id00258"><i>Cultus</i>. Military equipments. Cultus complectitur omnia, quae studio et
arte eis, quae natura instituit, adduntur. K.</p>

<p id="id00259"><i>Cassis aut galea</i>. <i>Cassis</i>, properly of metal; <i>galea</i> of leather (Gr.:
galen); though the distinction is not always observed.</p>

<p id="id00260"><i>Equi—conspicui</i>. Cf. Caes. B.G. 4, 2, 7, 65.</p>

<p id="id00261"><i>Sed nec variare</i>. <i>But</i> (i.e. on the other hand) <i>they are not even</i>
(for <i>nec</i> in this sense see Ritter in loc.) <i>taught to vary their
curves</i> (i.e. as the antithesis shows, to bend now towards the right and
now towards the left in their gyrations), <i>but they drive them straight
forward or by a constant bend towards the right in so connected a circle</i>
(i.e. a complete ring), <i>that no one is behind</i> (for the obvious reason,
that there is neither beginning nor end to such a ring). Such is on the
whole the most satisfactory explanation of this difficult passage, which
we can give after a careful examination. A different version was given in
the first edition. It refers not to battle, but to equestrian exercises,
cf. Gerlach, as cited by Or. in loc.</p>

<p id="id00262"><i>Aestimanti</i>. Greek idiom. Elliptical dative, nearly equivalent to the
abl. abs. (nobis aestimantibus), and called by some the dat. abs. In A.
II. the ellipsis is supplied by <i>credibile est</i>. Cf. Bötticher's Lex.
Tac. sub <i>Dativus</i>.</p>

<p id="id00263"><i>Eoque mixti. Eo</i>, causal particle==for that reason. Caesar adopted this
arrangement in the battle of Pharsalia. B.C. 3, 84. The Greeks also had
[Greek: pezoi amippoi]. Xen. Hellen. 7, 5.</p>

<p id="id00264"><i>Centeni</i>. A hundred is a favorite number with the Germans and their
descendants. Witness the hundred <i>pagi</i> of the Suevi (Caes. B.G. 4, 1),
and of the Semnones (G. 39), the <i>cantons</i> of Switzerland, and the
<i>hundreds</i> of our Saxon ancestors in England. The <i>centeni</i> here are a
military division. In like manner, Caesar (B.G. 4, 1) speaks of a
<i>thousand</i> men drafted annually from each <i>pagus</i> of the Suevi, for
military service abroad.</p>

<p id="id00265"><i>Idque ipsum</i>. Predicate nominative after a verb of calling, H. 362,
2. 2; Z. 394. The division was called a <i>hundred</i>, and each man in it a
<i>hundreder</i>; and such was the estimation in which this service was held,
that to be a hundreder, became an honorable distinction, <i>nomen et
honor</i>==honorificum nomen.</p>

<p id="id00266"><i>Cuneos</i>. A body of men arranged in the form of a wedge, i.e. narrow in
front and widening towards the rear; hence peculiarly adapted to break
the lines of the enemy.</p>

<p id="id00267"><i>Consilii quam formidinis</i>. Supply <i>magis</i>. The conciseness of T.
leads him often to omit one of two correlative particles, cf. note on
<i>minime</i>, 4.</p>

<p id="id00268"><i>Referunt. Carry into the rear</i>, and so secure them for burial.</p>

<p id="id00269"><i>Etiam in dubiis proeliis</i>. Even while the battle remains undecided. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00270"><i>Finierunt</i>. In a present or aorist sense, as often in T. So
<i>prohibuerunt</i>, § 10; <i>placuit</i> and <i>displicuit</i>, 11. cf. Lex. Tac. Böt.</p>

<p id="id00271" style="margin-top: 2em">VII. <i>Reges</i>, civil rulers; <i>duces</i>, military commanders. <i>Ex</i>==
secundum. So <i>ex ingenio</i>, § 3. The government was elective, yet not
without some regard to hereditary distinctions. They <i>chose (sumunt)</i>
their sovereign, but chose him from the royal family, or at least one of
noble extraction. They chose also their commander—the king, if he was
the bravest and ablest warrior; if not, they were at liberty to choose
some one else. And among the Germans, as among their descendants, the
Franks, the authority of the commander was quite distinct from, and
sometimes (in war) paramount to, that of the king. Here Montesquieu and
others find the original of the kings of the first race in the French
monarchy, and the <i>mayors of the palace</i>, who once had so much power in
France. Cf. Sp. of Laws, B. 31, chap. 4.</p>

<p id="id00272"><i>Nec</i> is correlative to <i>et. The kings on the one hand do not possess
unlimited or unrestrained authority, and the commanders on the other, &amp;c.
Infinita</i>==sine modo; <i>libera</i>==sine vinculo. Wr. <i>Potestas</i>==rightful
power, authority; <i>potentia</i>==power without regard to right, ability,
force, cf. note, 42. Ad rem, cf. Caes. B.G. 5, 27. Ambiorix tells Caesar,
that though he governed, yet the people made laws for him, and the
supreme power was shared equally between him and them.</p>

<p id="id00273"><i>Exemplo—imperio</i>. "<i>Dative</i> after <i>sunt==are to set an example, rather
than to give command</i>." So Grüber and Död. But Wr. and Rit. with more
reason consider them as ablatives of means limiting a verb implied in
<i>duces: commanders</i> (command) <i>more by example, than by authority</i>
(official power). See the principle well stated and illustrated in
Döderlein's Essay on the style of Tacitus, p. 15, in my edition of the
Histories.</p>

<p id="id00274"><i>Admiratione praesunt. Gain influence, or ascendency, by means of the
admiration which they inspire</i>, cf. note on metus, § 2.</p>

<p id="id00275"><i>Agant</i>. Subj., ut ad judicium admirantium, non mentem scriptoris
trahatur. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00276"><i>Animadvertere</i>==interficere. Cf. H. 1, 46. 68. <i>None but the priests are
allowed to put to death, to place in irons, nor even</i> (ne quidem) <i>to
scourge</i>. Thus punishment was clothed with divine authority.</p>

<p id="id00277"><i>Effigies et signa. Images and standards</i>, i.e. images, which serve for
standards. Images of wild beasts are meant, cf. H. 4, 22: depromptae
silvis lucisve ferarum imagines.—<i>Turmam</i>, cavalry. <i>Cuneum</i>, infantry,
but sometimes both. <i>Conglobatio</i> is found only in writers after the
Augustan age and rarely in them. It occurs in Sen. Qu. Nat. 1, 15, cf.
Freund.</p>

<p id="id00278"><i>Familiae</i> is less comprehensive than <i>propinquitates. Audiri</i>, sc.
solent. Cf. A. 34 <i>ruere</i>. Wr. calls it histor. inf., and Rit. pronounces
it a gloss.</p>

<p id="id00279"><i>Pignora</i>. Whatever is most dear, particularly mothers, wives, and
children.—<i>Unde</i>, adv. of place, referring to <i>in proximo</i>.</p>

<p id="id00280"><i>Vulnera ferunt</i>, i.e. on their return from battle.</p>

<p id="id00281"><i>Exigere. Examine</i>, and compare, to see who has the most and the most
honorable, or perhaps to soothe and dress them.—<i>Cibos et hortamina</i>.
Observe the singular juxtaposition of things so unlike. So 1: <i>metu aut
montibus</i>; A. 25: <i>copiis et laetitia</i>; 37: <i>nox et satietas</i>; 38:
<i>gaudio praedaque</i>.</p>

<p id="id00282" style="margin-top: 2em">VIII. <i>Constantia precum==importunate entreaties</i>.</p>

<p id="id00283"><i>Objectu pectorum. By opposing their breasts</i>, not to the enemy but to
their retreating husbands, praying for death in preference to captivity.</p>

<p id="id00284"><i>Monstrata—captivitate</i>. <i>Cominus</i> limits <i>captivitate</i>, pointing to
captivity as just before them.—<i>Impatientius</i>. <i>Impatienter</i> and
<i>impatientia</i> (the adv. and the subst.) are post-Augustan words. The adj.
(impatiens) is found earlier. Cf. Freund.</p>

<p id="id00285"><i>Feminarum—nomine</i>, i.e. propter feminas suas. Gün. So Cic.: tuo nomine
et reipublicae==on your account and for the sake of the republic. But it
means perhaps more than that here, viz. in the person of. They dreaded
captivity more for their women than for themselves. <i>Adeo==insomuch
that</i>.</p>

<p id="id00286"><i>Inesse</i>, sc. feminis. <i>They think, there is in their women something
sacred and prophetic</i>. Cf. Caes. B.G. 1, 50, where Caesar is informed by
the prisoners, that Ariovistus had declined an engagement because the
<i>women</i> had declared against coming to action before the new moon.—
<i>Consilia, advice</i> in general; <i>responsa, inspired answers</i>, when
consulted.</p>

<p id="id00287"><i>Vidimus</i>, i.e. she lived in our day—under the reign of Vespasian.—
<i>Veledam</i>. Cf. H. 4, 61. 65.</p>

<p id="id00288"><i>Auriniam</i>. Aurinia seems to have been a common name in Germany for
prophetess or wise woman. Perhaps==Al-runas, women knowing all things. So
<i>Veleda</i>==wise woman. Cf. Wr. in loc.</p>

<p id="id00289"><i>Non adulatione</i>, etc. "Not through adulation, nor as if they were
raising mortals to the rank of goddesses." Ky. This is one of those
oblique censures on Roman customs in which the treatise abounds. The
Romans in the excess of their adulation to the imperial family <i>made</i>
ordinary women goddesses, as Drusilla, sister of Caligula, the infant
daughter of Poppaea (Ann. 15, 23), and Poppaea herself (Dio 63, 29). The
Germans, on the other hand, really thought some of their wise women to be
divine. Cf. His. 4, 62, and my note ibid. Reverence and affection for
woman was characteristic of the German Tribes, and from them has diffused
itself throughout European society.</p>

<p id="id00290" style="margin-top: 2em">IX. <i>Deorum</i>. T. here, as elsewhere, applies Roman names, and puts a
Roman construction (Romana interpretatione, § 43), upon the gods of other
nations, cf. § 3.</p>

<p id="id00291"><i>Mercurium</i>. So Caes. B.G. 6, 17: Deum maxime Mercurium colunt. Probably
the German <i>Woden</i>, whose name is preserved in our Wednesday, as that of
Mercury is in the French name of the same day, and who with a name
slightly modified (Woden, Wuotan, Odin), was a prominent object of
worship among all the nations of Northern Europe. <i>Mars</i> is perhaps the
German god of war (Tiw, Tiu, Tuisco) whence Tuesday, French Mardi, cf.
Tur. His. Ang. Sax. App. to B. 2. chap. 3. <i>Herculem</i> is omitted by
Ritter on evidence (partly external and partly internal) which is
entitled to not a little consideration. Hercules is the god of strength,
perhaps Thor.</p>

<p id="id00292"><i>Certis diebus</i>. Statis diebus. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00293"><i>Humanis—hostiis</i>. Even <i>facere</i> in the sense of <i>sacrifice</i> is
construed with abl. Virg. Ec. 3, 77. <i>Quoque</i>==even. For its position in
the sentence, cf. note, 3.</p>

<p id="id00294"><i>Concessis animalibus</i>. Such as the Romans and other civilized nations
offer, in contradistinction to <i>human</i> sacrifices, which the author
regards as <i>in</i>-concessa. The attempt has been made to remove from the
Germans the stain of human sacrifices. But it rests on incontrovertible
evidence (cf. Tur. His. Ang. Sax., App. to B. 2. cap. 3), and indeed
attaches to them only in common with nearly all uncivilized nations. The
Gauls and Britons, and the Celtic nations generally, carried the practice
to great lengths, cf. Caes. B.G. 6, 15. The neighbors of the Hebrews
offered human victims in great numbers to their gods, as we learn from
the Scriptures. Nay, the reproach rests also upon the Greeks and Romans
in their early history. Pliny informs us, that men were sacrificed as
late as the year of Rome 657.</p>

<p id="id00295"><i>Isidi</i>. The Egyptian Isis in Germany! This shows, how far the Romans
went in comparing the gods of different nations. Gr. Ritter identifies
this goddess with the Nertha of chap. 40, the Egyptian Isis and Nertha
being both equivalent to Mother Earth, the Terra or Tellus of the Romans.</p>

<p id="id00296"><i>Liburnae</i>. A light galley, so called from the Liburnians, a people of
Illyricum, who built and navigated them. The <i>signum</i>, here likened to a
galley, was more probably a rude crescent, connected with the worship of
the moon, cf. Caes. B.G. 6, 21: Germani deorum numero ducunt Solem et
<i>Lunam</i>.</p>

<p id="id00297"><i>Cohibere parietibus</i>==aedificiis includere, K. T. elsewhere speaks of
temples of German divinities (e.g. 40: templum Nerthi; Ann. 1, 51:
templum Tanfanae); but a consecrated grove or any other sacred place was
called <i>templum</i> by the Romans (templum from [Greek: temno], cut off, set
apart).</p>

<p id="id00298"><i>Ex magnitudine</i>. <i>Ex</i>==secundum, cf. <i>ex nobilitate</i>, <i>ex virtute</i> § 7.
<i>Ex magnitudine</i> is predicate after <i>arbitrantur: they deem it unbecoming
the greatness</i>, etc.</p>

<p id="id00299"><i>Humani—speciem</i>. Images of the gods existed at a later day in Germany
(S. Tur. His. of Ang. Sax., App. to B. 2. cap. 3). But this does not
prove their existence in the days of T. Even as late as A.D. 240 Gregory
Thaumaturgus expressly declares, there were no images among the Goths. No
traces of temple-walls or images have been discovered in connection with
the numerous sites of ancient altars or places of offering which have
been exhumed in <i>Germany</i>, though both these are found on the <i>borders</i>,
both south and west, cf. Ukert, p. 236.</p>

<p id="id00300"><i>Lucos et nemora</i>. "Lucus (a [Greek: lukae], crepusculum) sylva densior,
obumbrans; nemus ([Greek: nemos]) sylva rarior, in quo jumenta et pecora
pascuntur." Bredow.</p>

<p id="id00301"><i>Deorumque—vident. They invoke under the name of gods that mysterious
existence, which they see</i> (not under any human or other visible form,
but) <i>with the eye of spiritual reverence alone</i>. So Gr. and K. Others
get another idea thus loosely expressed: They give to that sacred recess
the name of the divinity that fills the place, which is never profaned by
the steps of man.</p>

<p id="id00302"><i>Sola reverentia</i>, cf. <i>sola mente</i> applied by T. to the spiritual
religion of the Jews, H. 5, 5. The religion of the Germans and other
northern tribes was more spiritual than that of southern nations, when
both were Pagan. And after the introduction of Christianity, the Germans
were disinclined to the image-worship of the Papists.</p>

<p id="id00303" style="margin-top: 2em">X. <i>Auspicia sortesque</i>. <i>Auspicia</i> (avis-spicia) properly divination by
observing the flight and cry of birds; <i>sortes</i>, by drawing lots: but
both often used in the general sense of omens, oracles.</p>

<p id="id00304"><i>Ut qui maxime</i>, sc. <i>observant</i>. Ellipsis supplied by repeating
<i>observant</i>==to the greatest extent, none more.</p>

<p id="id00305"><i>Simplex</i>. Sine Romana arte, cf. Cic. de Div. 2, 41, K. The Scythians had
a similar method of divining, Herod. 4, 67. Indeed, the practice of
<i>divining</i> by <i>rods</i> has hardly ceased to this day, among the descendants
of the German Tribes.</p>

<p id="id00306"><i>Temere</i>, without plan on the part of the diviner.—<i>Fortuito</i>, under the
direction of chance. Gr.</p>

<p id="id00307"><i>Si publice consuletur</i>. If the question to be decided is of a public
nature. <i>Consuletur</i>, fut., because at the time of drawing lots the
deliberation and decision are future. Or it may refer to the consultation
of the gods (cf. Ann. 14, 30: <i>consulere deos</i>): <i>if it is by the state
that the gods are to be consulted</i>. So Ritter in his last edition.</p>

<p id="id00308"><i>Ter singulos tollit</i>. A three-fold drawing for the sake of certainty.
Thus Ariovistus drew lots three times touching the death of Valerius
(Caes. B.G. 1, 53). So also the Romans drew lots three times, Tibul. 1,
3, 10: sortes ter sustulit. Such is the interpretation of these disputed
words by Grüber, Ritter and many others, and such is certainly their
natural and obvious meaning: <i>he takes up three times one after another</i>
all the slips he has <i>scattered</i> (<i>spargere</i> is hardly applicable to
<i>three</i> only): if the signs are twice or thrice favorable, the thing is
permitted; if twice or thrice unfavorable it is prohibited. The language
of Caesar (in loc. cit.) is still more explicit: <i>ter sortibus
consultum</i>. But Or., Wr. and Död. understand simply the taking up of
three lots one each time.</p>

<p id="id00309"><i>Si prohibuerunt</i> sc. sortes==dii. The reading <i>prohibuerunt</i> (aL
prohibuerint) is favored by the analogy of <i>si displicuit</i>, 11, and other
passages. <i>Sin (==si—ne)</i> is particularly frequent in antithesis with
<i>si</i>, and takes the same construction after it.</p>

<p id="id00310"><i>Auspiciorum—exigitur. Auspiciorum</i>, here some other omens, than lots;
such as the author proceeds to specify. <i>Adhuc</i>==ad hoc, praeterea, i.e.
in addition to the lots. The sense is: <i>besides drawing lots, the
persuasion produced by auspices is required</i>.</p>

<p id="id00311"><i>Etiam hic</i>. In Germany also (as well as at Rome and other well known
countries). <i>Hic</i> is referred to Rome by some. But it was hardly needful
for T. to inform the Romans of that custom at Rome.</p>

<p id="id00312"><i>Proprium gentis. It is a peculiarity of the German race</i>. It is not,
however, exclusively German. Something similar prevailed among the
Persians, Herod. 1, 189. 7, 55. Darius Hystaspes was indebted to the
neighing of his horse for his elevation to the throne.</p>

<p id="id00313"><i>Iisdem memoribus</i>, § 9.—<i>Mortali opere</i>==hominum opere.—<i>Contacti</i>.
Notio contaminandi inest, K.—<i>Pressi curru</i>. Harnessed to the sacred
chariot. More common, pressi jugo. Poetice.</p>

<p id="id00314"><i>Conscios</i> sc. deorum. <i>The priests consider themselves the servants of
the gods, the horses the confidants of the same</i>. So Tibullus speaks of
the <i>conscia</i> fibra <i>deorum</i>. Tibul. 1, 8, 3.</p>

<p id="id00315"><i>Committunt</i>. Con and mitto, send together==<i>engage in fight</i>. A
technical expression used of gladiators and champions.</p>

<p id="id00316"><i>Praejudicio. Sure prognostic</i>. Montesquieu finds in this custom the
origin of the duel and of knight-errantry.</p>

<p id="id00317" style="margin-top: 2em">XI. <i>Apud—pertractentur. Are handled</i>, i.e. discussed, among, i.e. <i>by
the chiefs</i>, sc. before being referred to the people.</p>

<p id="id00318"><i>Nisi</i> refers not to <i>coeunt</i>, but to <i>certis diebus</i>.</p>

<p id="id00319"><i>Fortuitum</i>, casual, unforeseen; <i>subitum</i>, requiring immediate action.</p>

<p id="id00320"><i>Inchoatur—impletur</i>. Ariovistus would not <i>fight</i> before the new moon,
Caes. B.G. 1, 50.</p>

<p id="id00321"><i>Numerum—noctium</i>. Of which custom, we have a relic and a proof in our
seven-<i>night</i> and fort-<i>night</i>. So also the Gauls. Caes. B.G. 6, 18.</p>

<p id="id00322"><i>Constituunt</i>==decree, determine; <i>condicunt</i>==proclaim, appoint. The
<i>con</i> in both implies <i>concerted</i> or public action. They are forensic
terms.</p>

<p id="id00323"><i>Nox—videtur</i>. So with the Athenians, Macrob. Saturn. 1, 3.; and the
Hebrews, Gen. 1, 5.</p>

<p id="id00324"><i>Ex libertate</i>, sc. <i>ortum, arising from</i>. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00325"><i>Nec ut jussi. Not precisely at the appointed time</i>, but a day or two
later, if they choose.</p>

<p id="id00326"><i>Ut turbae placuit. Ut</i>==simul ac, as soon as, <i>when</i>. It is the <i>time of
commencing their session</i>, that depends on the will of the multitude; not
their sitting <i>armed</i>, for that they always did, cf. <i>frameas concutiunt</i>
at the close of the section; also § 13: nihil neque publicae neque
privatae rei nisi armati agunt. To express this latter idea, the order of
the words would have been reversed thus: <i>armati considunt</i>.</p>

<p id="id00327"><i>Tum et coercendi</i>. When the session is commenced, <i>then (tum)</i> the
priests have the right not merely to command silence, but <i>also (et) to
enforce it</i>. This use of <i>et</i> for <i>etiam</i> is very rare in Cic., but
frequent in Livy, T. and later writers. See note, His. 1, 23.</p>

<p id="id00328"><i>Imperatur. Imperare</i> plus est, quam <i>jubere</i>. See the climax in Ter.
Eun. 2, 3, 98; jubeo, cogo atque impero. <i>Impero</i> is properly military
command. K.</p>

<p id="id00329"><i>Prout</i> refers, not to the order of speaking, but to the degree of
influence they have over the people. Gr.—<i>Aetas</i>. Our word <i>alderman</i>
(elderman) is a proof, that office and honor were conferred on <i>age</i> by
our German ancestors. So <i>senator</i> (senex) among the Romans.</p>

<p id="id00330"><i>Armis laudare</i>, i.e. armis concussis. "Montesquieu is of opinion that
in this Treatise on the manners of the Germans, an attentive reader may
trace the origin of the British constitution. That beautiful system, he
says, was formed in the forests of Germany, Sp. of Laws 11, 6. The
<i>Saxon</i> Witena-gemot (Parliament) was, beyond all doubt, an improved
political institution, grafted on the rights exercised by the people in
their own country." Murphy, cf. S. Tur. His. of Ang. Sax. B. 8. cap. 4</p>

<p id="id00331" style="margin-top: 2em">XII. <i>Accusare—intendere. To accuse and impeach for capital crimes</i>.
Minor offences were tried before the courts described at the end of the
section.—<i>Quoque</i>. In addition to the legislative power spoken of in the
previous section, the council exercised <i>also</i> certain judicial
functions. <i>Discrimen capitis intendere</i>, lit. <i>to endeavor to bring one
in danger of losing his life</i>.</p>

<p id="id00332"><i>Ignavos—infames. The sluggish, the cowardly, and the impure</i>; for so
<i>corpore infames</i> usually means, and there is no sufficient reason for
adopting another sense here. <i>Infames</i> foeda Veneris aversae nota. K. Gr.
understands those, whose persons were disfigured by dishonorable wounds,
or who had mutilated themselves to avoid military duty. Gün. includes
both ideas: <i>quocunque</i>, non tantum <i>venereo</i>, corporis abusu contempti.</p>

<p id="id00333"><i>Insuper</i>==superne. So 16: multo <i>insuper</i> fimo onerant.</p>

<p id="id00334"><i>Diversitas</i> is a post-Augustan word, cf. Freund, sub v.</p>

<p id="id00335"><i>Illuc respicit. Has respect to this principle. Scelera==crimes;
flagitia==vices, low and base actions. Scelus</i> poena, <i>flagitium</i>
contemptu dignum. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00336"><i>Levioribus delictis</i>. Abl. abs.==<i>when lighter offences are committed</i>;
or abl. of circum.==<i>in case of lighter offences</i>.</p>

<p id="id00337"><i>Pro modo poenarum</i>. Such is the reading of all the MSS. <i>Pro modo,
poena</i> is an ingenious <i>conjecture</i> of Acidalius. But it is unnecessary.
Render thus: <i>in case of lighter offences, the convicted persons are
mulcted in a number of horses or cattle, in proportion to the severity of
the sentence adjudged to be due</i>.</p>

<p id="id00338"><i>Qui vindicatur. The injured party</i>, or <i>plaintiff</i>. This principle
of pecuniary satisfaction was carried to great lengths among the
Anglo-Saxons. See Turner, as cited, 21.</p>

<p id="id00339"><i>Qui reddunt</i>. Whose <i>business</i> or <i>custom</i> it is to administer justice,
etc. E. proposes <i>reddant</i>. But it is without authority and would give a
less appropriate sense.</p>

<p id="id00340"><i>Centeni</i>. Cf. note, § 6: centeni ex singulis pagis. "Sunt in quibusdam
locis Germaniae, velut Palatinatu, Franconia, etc. Zentgericht
(hundred-courts)," cf. Bernegger.</p>

<p id="id00341"><i>Consilia et auctoritas</i>. Abstract for concrete==<i>his advisers and the
supporters of his dignity</i>.</p>

<p id="id00342" style="margin-top: 2em">XIII. <i>Nihil nisi armati</i>. The <i>Romans</i> wore arms only in time of war or
on a journey.</p>

<p id="id00343"><i>Moris</i>, sc. est. A favorite expression of T. So 21: concedere moris
(est). And in A. 39.</p>

<p id="id00344"><i>Suffecturum probaverit. On examination has pronounced him competent</i>
(sc. to bear arms). Subj. after <i>antequam</i>. H. 523, II.; Z. 576.</p>

<p id="id00345"><i>Ornant. Ornat</i> would have been more common Latin, and would have made
better English. But this construction is not unfrequent in T., cf. 11:
rex vel princeps audiuntur. Nor is it without precedent in other authors.
Cf. Z. 374. Ritter reads <i>propinqui</i>. The attentive reader will discover
here traces of many subsequent usages of <i>chivalry</i>.</p>

<p id="id00346"><i>Haec toga</i>. This is the badge of manhood among the Germans, as the toga
virilis was among the Romans. The Romans assumed the toga at the age of
seventeen. The Athenians were reckoned as [Greek: Ephaeboi] at the same
age, Xen. Cyr, 1, 2, 8. The Germans (in their colder climate) not till
the 20th year. Caes. B.G. 6, 21.</p>

<p id="id00347"><i>Dignationem. Rank, title</i>. It differs from <i>dignitas</i> in being more
external. Cf. H. 1, 19: <i>dignatio Caesaris</i>; 8, 80: <i>dignatio viri</i>.
Ritter reads <i>dignitatem</i>.</p>

<p id="id00348"><i>Assignant. High birth or great merits of their fathers assign</i> (i.e.
mark out, not consign, or fully confer) <i>the title of chief even to young
men</i>.</p>

<p id="id00349"><i>Gradus—habet</i>. Observe the emphatic position of <i>gradus</i>, and the force
of <i>quin etiam ipse: Gradations of rank, moreover the retinue itself
has</i>, i.e. the retainers are not only distinguished as a body in
following such a leader, <i>but</i> there are <i>also distinctions</i> among
<i>themselves. Quin etiam</i> seldom occupies the second place. T. is fond of
anastrophe. Cf. Böt. Lex. Tac.</p>

<p id="id00350"><i>Si—emineat. If he</i> (cuique) <i>stands pre-eminent for the number and
valor of his followers. Comitatus</i> is gen. <i>Emineat</i>, subj. pres. H. 504
et 509; Z. 524.</p>

<p id="id00351"><i>Ceteris—aspici</i>. These noble youth, thus designated to the rank of
chieftains, <i>attach themselves</i> (for a time, with some followers perhaps)
<i>to the other</i> chiefs, who are <i>older and already distinguished, nor are
they ashamed to be seen among their attendants</i>.</p>

<p id="id00352"><i>Quibus—cui</i>, sc. sit==<i>who shall have</i>, etc.</p>

<p id="id00353"><i>Ipsa fama. Mere reputation</i> or <i>rumor</i> without coming to arms.</p>

<p id="id00354"><i>Profligant</i>==ad finem perducunt. So Kiessling, Bötticher and Freund.
Ritter makes it==<i>propellunt</i>, frighten away. <i>Profligare bella,
proelia</i>, &amp;c., is Tacitean. <i>Profligare hostes</i>, etc., is the common
expression.</p>

<p id="id00355" style="margin-top: 2em">XIV. <i>Jam vero</i>==porro. Cf. Böt. Lex. Tac. It marks a transition to a
topic of special importance. Cf. H. 1, 2. See Död, in loc.</p>

<p id="id00356"><i>Recessisse</i>. All the best Latin writers are accustomed to use the
preterite after pudet, taedet, and other words of the like signification.
Gün. The cause of shame is prior to the shame.</p>

<p id="id00357"><i>Infame</i>. "When Chonodomarus, king of the Alemanni, was taken prisoner by
the Romans, his military companions, to the number of two hundred, and
three of the king's most intimate friends, thinking it a most flagitious
crime to live in safety after such an event, surrendered themselves to be
loaded with fetters. Ammian. Marcell, 16, 12, 60. There are instances of
the same kind in Tacitus." Mur. Cf. also Caes. B.G. 3, 22. 7, 40.</p>

<p id="id00358"><i>Defendere, to defend him</i>, when attacked; <i>tueri, to protect him</i> at all
times.</p>

<p id="id00359"><i>Praecipuum sacramentum. Their most sacred duty</i>, Gün. and K.; <i>or the
chief part of their oath</i>, Gr.—<i>Clarescunt—tuentur</i>. So Ritter after
the best MSS. Al. <i>clarescant—tueantur</i>, or <i>tueare</i>.</p>

<p id="id00360"><i>Non nisi</i>. In Cic. usually separated by a word or a clause. In T.
generally brought together.</p>

<p id="id00361"><i>Exigunt. They expect.—Illum—illam</i>. Angl. <i>this—that</i>, cf.
<i>hinc—hinc</i>, A. 25.—<i>Bellatorem equum</i>. Cf. Virg. G. 2, 145.</p>

<p id="id00362"><i>Incompti—apparatus. Entertainments, though inelegant yet liberal.
Apparatus</i> is used in the same way, Suet. Vitel. 10 and 13.—<i>Cedunt</i>==
iis dantur. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00363"><i>Nec arare</i>, etc. The whole language of this sentence is poetical, e.g.
the use of the inf. after <i>persuaseris</i>, of <i>annum</i> for annuam mensem,
the sense of <i>vocare</i> and <i>mereri</i>, &amp;c. <i>Vocare</i>, i.e. provocare, cf. H.
4, 80, and Virg. Geor. 4, 76. <i>Mereri, earn, deserve</i>, i.e. by bravery.</p>

<p id="id00364"><i>Pigrum et iners</i>. Piger est natura ad laborem tardus; iners, in quo
nihil artis et virtutis. K. Render: <i>a mark of stupidity and incapacity</i>.</p>

<p id="id00365"><i>Quin immo. Nay but, nay more</i>. These words connect the clause, though
not placed at the beginning, as they are by other writers. They seem to
be placed after <i>pigrum</i> in order to throw it into an emphatic position.
So <i>gradus quin etiam</i>, 13, where see note.—<i>Possis</i>. You, i.e., any one
can. Z. 524. Cf. note II. 1, 10: <i>laudares</i>. So <i>persuaseris</i> in the
preceding sentence. The subj. gives a contingent or potential turn==<i>can
procure</i>, sc. if you will <i>would persuade</i>, sc. if you should try. An
indefinite person is always addressed in the subj. in Latin, even when
the ind. would be used if a definite person were addressed. Z. 524.</p>

<p id="id00366">In the chieftains and their retainers, as described in the last two
sections, the reader cannot fail to discover the germ of the feudal
system. Cf. Montesq. Sp. of Laws, 30, 3, 4; also Robertson's Chas. V.</p>

<p id="id00367" style="margin-top: 2em">XV. <i>Non multum</i>. The common reading (multum without the negative) is a
mere conjecture, and that suggested by a misapprehension of the meaning
of T. <i>Non multum</i> is to be taken comparatively. Though in time of peace
they hunt often, yet they spend <i>so much more time in eating, drinking,
and sleeping</i>, that the former is comparatively small. Thus understood,
this passage of T. is not inconsistent with the declarations of Caesar,
B.G. 6, 21: Vita Germanorum omnis in venationibus atque in studiis rei
militaris consistit. Caesar leaves out of account their periods of
inaction, and speaks only of their active employments, which were war and
the chase. It was the special object of Tacitus, on the contrary, to give
prominence to that striking feature of the German character which Caesar
overlooks; and therein, as Wr. well observes, the later historian shows
his more exact acquaintance with the Germans. <i>Non multum</i>, as opposed to
<i>plus</i>, is nearly equivalent to <i>minus</i>.</p>

<p id="id00368"><i>Venatibus, per otium</i>. Enallage for <i>venatibus, otio</i>, H. 704, III. This
figure is very frequent in T., e.g. § 40: per obsequium, proeliis; A. 9:
virtute aut per artem; A. 41: temeritate aut per ignaviam, &amp;c. Seneca,
and indeed most Latin authors, prefer a <i>similar</i> construction in
antithetic clauses; T. seems rather to avoid it. In all such cases
however, as the examples just cited show, <i>per</i> with the acc. is not
precisely equivalent to the abl. The abl. is more active and implies
means, agency; the acc. with <i>per</i> is more passive and denotes manner or
occasion.</p>

<p id="id00369"><i>Delegata, transferred</i>.</p>

<p id="id00370"><i>Familiae. Household</i>, properly of servants (from famel, Oscan for
servant), as in chapp. 25 and 32: but sometimes the whole family, as here
and in chap. 7: <i>familiae et propinquitates</i>.</p>

<p id="id00371"><i>Ipsi</i>. The men of middle life, the heads of the <i>familiae</i>.</p>

<p id="id00372"><i>Diversitate. Contrariety.—Ament</i>. Subj. H. 518, I.; Z. 577.—
<i>Oderint</i>. Perf. in the sense of the pres. H. 297, I. 2; Z. 221.</p>

<p id="id00373"><i>Inertiam. Inertiam==idleness</i>, freedom from business and care (from <i>in</i>
and <i>ars</i>); <i>quietem==tranquillity</i>, a life of undisturbed repose without
action or excitement. Cf. 14: <i>ingrata genti quies</i>. In this account of
the habits of the Germans, one might easily fancy, he was reading a
description of the manner of life among our American Indians. It may be
remarked here, once for all, that this resemblance may be traced in very
many particulars, e.g. in their personal independence, in the military
chieftains and their followers, in their extreme fondness for the
hardships and dangers of war, in their strange inactivity, gluttony and
drunkenness in peace, in their deliberative assemblies and the power of
eloquence to sway their counsels, in their half elective, half hereditary
form of government, in the spirituality of their conceptions of God, and
some other features of their religion (Robertson has drawn out this
comparison in his history of Charles V). All tribes in a rude and savage
state must have many similar usages and traits of character. And this
resemblance between the well-known habits of our wandering savages and
those which T. ascribes to the rude tribes of Germany, may impress us
with confidence in the truthfulness of his narrative.</p>

<p id="id00374"><i>Vel armentorum vel frugum</i>. Partitive gen. Supply aliquid.—
<i>Vel—vel==whether—or</i>, merely distinctive; <i>aut—aut==either—or</i>,
adversative and exclusive. <i>Vel—vel</i> (from <i>volo</i>) implies, that one
may <i>choose</i> between the alternatives or particulars named; <i>aut—aut</i>
(from [Greek: au, autis]), that if one is affirmed, the other is denied,
since both cannot be true at the same time. Cf. note, A. 17: <i>aut—aut.
—Pecuniam</i>. An oblique censure of the Romans for purchasing peace and
alliance with the Germans, cf. H. 4, 76. Herodian 6, 7: [Greek: touto
gar (sc. chrusio) malista Germanoi peithontai, philargyroi te
ontes kai taen eiraenaen aei pros tous Romaious chrusiou kapaeleuontes].
On <i>et</i>, cf. note 11.</p>

<p id="id00375">XVI. <i>Populis</i>. Dative of the agent instead of the abl. with <i>a</i> or <i>ab</i>.<br/>

Cf. note 3: <i>Ulixi</i>.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00376"><i>Ne—quidem</i>. These words are always separated, the word on which the
emphasis rests being placed between them. H. 602, III. 2; Z. 801. Here
however the emphasis seems to belong to the whole clause—<i>Inter se</i>, sc.
<i>sedes junctas inter se</i>.</p>

<p id="id00377"><i>Colunt</i>==in-colunt. Both often used intransitively, or rather with an
ellipsis of the object,==<i>dwell</i>.</p>

<p id="id00378"><i>Discreti ac diversi. Separate and scattered</i> in different directions,
i.e. without regular streets or highways. See Or. in loc.</p>

<p id="id00379"><i>Ut fons—placuit</i>. Hence to this day, the names of German towns often
end in bach (brook), feld (field), holz (grove), wald (wood), born
(spring). On the permanence of names of places, see note H. 1, 53.</p>

<p id="id00380"><i>Connexis</i>, with some intervening link, such as fences, hedges, and
outhouses; <i>cohaerentibus</i>, in immediate contact.</p>

<p id="id00381"><i>Remedium—inscitia. It may be as a remedy</i>, etc.—<i>or it may be through
ignorance</i>, etc. <i>Sive—sive</i> expresses an alternative conditionally,
or contingently==it may be thus, or it may be thus. Compare it with
<i>vel—vel</i>, chap. 15, and with <i>aut—aut</i>, A 17. See also Ramshorn's
Synonyms, 138. <i>Remedium</i> is acc. in app. with the foregoing clause.
<i>Inscitia</i> is abl. of cause==per inscitiam.</p>

<p id="id00382"><i>Caementorum</i>. Properly <i>hewn</i> stone (from caedo), but in usage any
building stone.—<i>Tegularum</i>. Tiles, any materials for the <i>roof</i> (tego),
whether of brick, stone, or wood.</p>

<p id="id00383"><i>Citra</i>. Properly this side of, hence short of, or <i>without</i>, as used by
the <i>later</i> Latin authors. This word is kindred to <i>cis</i>, i.e. <i>is</i> with
the demonstrative prefix <i>ce</i>. Cf. Freund sub v.</p>

<p id="id00384"><i>Speciem</i> refers more to the <i>eye, delectationem</i> to the <i>mind</i>. Taken
with <i>citra</i>, they are equivalent to adjectives, connected to <i>informi</i>
and limiting <i>materia</i> (citra speciem==non speciosa, Gün.). Render:
<i>rude materials, neither beautiful to the eye nor attractive to the
taste</i>. <i>Materia</i> is distinctively wood for building. Fire-wood is
<i>lignum</i>.</p>

<p id="id00385"><i>Quaedam loca</i>. Some parts of their houses, e.g. the walls.</p>

<p id="id00386"><i>Terra ita pura</i>. Probably red earth, such as chalk or gypsum.</p>

<p id="id00387"><i>Imitetur. Resembles painting and colored outlines</i> or figures.</p>

<p id="id00388"><i>Aperire</i>. Poetice==<i>excavate</i>. Cellars under ground were unknown to the
Romans. See Beck. Gal., and Smith's Dict. Ant.</p>

<p id="id00389"><i>Ignorantur—fallunt. They are not known to exist, or else</i> (though known
to exist) <i>they escape discovery from the very fact that they must be
sought</i> (in order to be found). Gün. calls attention to the multiform
enallage in this sentence: 1. in number (<i>populatur, ignorantur,
fallunt</i>); 2. of the active, passive, and deponent verbs; 3. in the
change of cases (<i>aperta</i>, acc.; <i>abdita</i> and <i>defossa</i>, nom.).</p>

<p id="id00390" style="margin-top: 2em">XVII. <i>Sagum</i>. A short, thick cloak, worn by Roman soldiers and
countrymen.</p>

<p id="id00391"><i>Fibula</i>==figibula, any artificial fastening; <i>spina</i>==natural.</p>

<p id="id00392"><i>Si desit</i>. Observe the difference between this clause, and <i>si quando
advenit</i> in the preceding chapter. This is a mere supposition without
regard to fact; that implies an expectation, that the case will sometimes
happen.</p>

<p id="id00393"><i>Cetera intecti. Uncovered as to the rest of the body</i>, cf. 6: nudi aut
sagulo leves.</p>

<p id="id00394"><i>Totos dies</i>. Acc. of duration of time.—<i>Agunt</i>==vivunt. K.</p>

<p id="id00395"><i>Fluitante</i>. The flowing robe of the southern and eastern nations;
<i>stricta</i>, the close dress and short clothes of the northern nations.</p>

<p id="id00396"><i>Artus exprimente</i>. Quae tam arte artus includit, ut emineant, earumque
lineamenta et forma appareant, K. K. and Gr. understand this of coat and
vest, as well as breeches; Gün. of breeches only.</p>

<p id="id00397"><i>Proximi ripae</i>. Near the banks of the Rhine and the Danube, so as to
have commercial intercourse with the Romans. These having introduced the
cloth and dress of the Romans, attached little importance to the manner
of wearing their <i>skins</i>. But those in the interior, having no other
apparel, valued themselves on the nice adjustment of them.</p>

<p id="id00398"><i>Cultus</i>, artificial refinement. Cf. note, 6.</p>

<p id="id00399"><i>Maculis pellibusque</i>, for maculatis pellibus or maculis pellium, perhaps
to avoid the concurrence of genitives.</p>

<p id="id00400"><i>Belluarum—gignit. Oceanus</i>==terrae, quas Oceanus alluit; and
<i>belluae</i>==lutrae, mustelae, erminiae, etc., so K. But Gr. says <i>belluae</i>
cannot mean such small creatures, and agrees with Lipsius, in
understanding by it marine animals, seadogs, seals, &amp;c. Freund connects
it in derivation with [Greek: thaer], fera (bel==ber==ther==fer), but
defines it as properly an animal remarkable for size or wildness.
<i>Exterior Oceanus</i>==Oceanus extra orbem Romanum, further explained by
<i>ignotum mare</i>. Cf. note, 2: adversus Oceanus.</p>

<p id="id00401"><i>Habitus</i>, here==vestitus; in § 4.==forma corporis.</p>

<p id="id00402"><i>Saepius, oftener</i> than the <i>men</i>, who also wore linen more or less. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00403"><i>Purpura</i>. Facta e succo plantis et floribus expresso. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00404"><i>Nudae—lacertos</i>. Graece et poetice. Brachia a manu ad cubitum; lacerti
a cubito ad humeros.</p>

<p id="id00405" style="margin-top: 2em">XVIII. <i>Quanquam</i>==sed tamen, i.e. notwithstanding the great freedom in
the dress of German women, yet the marriage relation is sacred. This use
of <i>quanquam</i> is not unfrequent in T., and sometimes occurs in Cic.,
often in Pliny. See Z. 341, N.</p>

<p id="id00406"><i>Qui ambiuntur</i>. This passage is construed in two ways: <i>who are
surrounded</i> (ambiuntur==circumdantur, cf. II. 5, 12.) <i>by many wives not
to gratify lust, but to increase their rank and influence</i> (<i>ob</i> in the
sense <i>for the sake of</i>, cf. ob metum, 2). Or thus: <i>who</i> (take many
wives) <i>not to gratify lust, but on account of their rank they are
solicited to form many matrimonial alliances</i>. For <i>ambio</i> in this sense
and with the same somewhat peculiar construction after it, see H. 4, 51:
<i>tantis sociorum auxiliis ambiri</i>; also Virg. Aen. 7, 333: connubiis
ambire Latinum. The latter is preferable, and is adopted by Wr., K., Gr.,
&amp;c. The former by Gün. and others. Ariovistus had two wives. Caes. B.G.
1, 53.</p>

<p id="id00407"><i>Probant</i>, cf. probaverit, 13, note.—<i>Comatur</i>. Subj. denoting the
intention of the presents <i>with which she is to be adorned</i>. H 500, 1; Z.
567.</p>

<p id="id00408"><i>Frenatum</i>, bridled, <i>caparisoned==paratus</i> below.</p>

<p id="id00409"><i>In haec munera</i>==[Greek: epi toutois tois dorois]. <i>In</i>==upon the basis
of, <i>on condition of</i>. So Liv.: in has leges, in easdem leges.</p>

<p id="id00410"><i>Hoc—vinculum</i>, So, § 13: haec apud illos toga. In both passages the
allusion is to Roman customs (for which see Becker's Gallus, Exc. 1.
Scene 1). In Germany, <i>these presents</i> take the place of the
<i>confarreatio</i> (see Fiske's Manual, p. 286. 4. ed.), and the various
other methods of ratifying the marriage contract at Rome; <i>these</i>, of
the religious rites in which the parties mutually engaged on the wedding
day (see Man., p. 287).—<i>Conjugales deos</i>. Certain gods at Rome
presided over marriage, e.g. Jupiter, Juno, Venus, Jugatinus, Hymenaeus,
Diana, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id00411"><i>Extra</i>. Cic. would have said <i>expertem</i> or <i>positum extra</i>. But T. is
fond of the adv. used elliptically.</p>

<p id="id00412"><i>Auspiciis==initiatory rites</i>.</p>

<p id="id00413"><i>Denuntiant, proclaim, denote.—Accipere</i> depends on <i>denuntiant</i> or
<i>admonetur</i>.</p>

<p id="id00414"><i>Rursus, quae—referantur</i>. Rhenanus conjectured; rursusque—referant,
which has since become the common reading. But <i>referantur</i> is the
reading of all the MSS., and needs no emendation; and <i>quae</i>, with as
good authority as <i>que</i>, makes the construction more natural and the
sense more apposite. The passage, as Gr. well suggests, consists of two
parts (<i>accipere—reddat</i>, and <i>quae—accipiant—referantur</i>), <i>each</i> of
which includes the <i>two</i> ideas of <i>receiving</i> and <i>handing down</i> to the
next generation. Render thus: <i>she is reminded that she receives gifts,
which she is to hand over pure and unsullied to her children; which her
daughters-in-law are to receive again</i> (sc. from her sons, as she did
from her husband), <i>which are to be transmitted by them to her
grand-children</i>.</p>

<p id="id00415"><i>Referantur</i>. In another writer, we might expect <i>referant</i> to correspond
in construction and subject with <i>accipiant</i>. But Tacitus is fond of
varying the construction. Cf. Bötticher's Lex Tac., and note, 16:
<i>ignorantur</i>.</p>

<p id="id00416" style="margin-top: 2em">XIX. <i>Septa</i>. So the MSS. for the most part. Al. <i>septae</i>. Meaning: <i>with
chastity guarded</i>, sc. by the sacredness of marriage and the excellent
institutions of the Germans.</p>

<p id="id00417"><i>Nullis—corruptae</i>. Here, as every where else in this treatise, T.
appears as the censor of Roman manners. He has in mind those fruitful
sources of corruption at Rome, public shows, (cf. Sen. Epist. 7: <i>nihil
vero est tam damnosum bonis moribus, quam in aliquo spectaculo
desidere</i>), convivial entertainments (cf. Hor. Od. 3, 6, 27), and
epistolary correspondence between the two sexes.</p>

<p id="id00418"><i>Litterarum secreta</i>==litteras secretas, <i>secret correspondence</i> between
the sexes, for this limitation is obvious from the connexion.—
<i>Praesens. Immediate</i>.</p>

<p id="id00419"><i>Maritis permissa</i>, sc. as a <i>domestic</i> crime, cf. Caes. B.G. 6, 19: Viri
in uxores, sicut in liberos, vitae necisque habent potestatem. Cf. Beck.
Gall., Exc. 1. Sc. 1.</p>

<p id="id00420"><i>Accisis crinibus</i>, as a special mark of <i>disgrace</i>, cf. 1 Cor. 11, 6. So
in the laws of the Lombards, the punishment of adulteresses was
<i>decalvari et fustigari.—Omnem vicum, the whole village</i>, cf. Germania
omnis, § 1.—<i>Aetate==juventa</i>.</p>

<p id="id00421"><i>Non—invenerit. She would not find, could not expect to find</i>. This use
of the perf. subj., for a softened fut., occurs in negative sentences
oftener than in positive ones. Cf. Arnold's Prose Comp. 417, Note.</p>

<p id="id00422"><i>Saeculum</i>==indoles et mores saeculi, <i>the spirit of the age, the
fashion</i>.</p>

<p id="id00423"><i>Adhuc</i> (==ad-hoc) is generally used by Cicero, and often by Tacitus, in
the sense either of <i>still</i> (to this day), or <i>moreover</i> (in addition to
this). From these, it passed naturally, in Quintilian and the writers
after him, into the sense of <i>even more, still more, even</i>, especially in
connection with the comparative degree; where the authors of the Augustan
age would have used <i>etiam</i>. See Z. 486; Bötticher's Lex. Tac. sub. voce;
and Hand's Tursellinus, vol. 1. I. 165. <i>Melius quidem adhuc==still
better even</i>. For a verb, supply <i>sunt</i> or <i>agunt</i>. Cf. note A. 19:
<i>nihil</i>.</p>

<p id="id00424"><i>Eae civitates</i>. Such as the Heruli, among whom the wife was expected to
hang herself at once at the grave of her husband, if she would not live
in perpetual infamy. At Rome, on the contrary, divorces and marriages
might be multiplied to any extent, cf. Mart. 6, 7: <i>nubit decimo viro</i>;
also Beck, as above cited.</p>

<p id="id00425"><i>Semel</i>, like [Greek: apax], <i>once for all</i>.</p>

<p id="id00426"><i>Transigitur</i>. Properly a business phrase. The business is <i>done up,
brought to an end</i>. So A. 34: transigite cum expeditionibus.</p>

<p id="id00427"><i>Ultra</i>, sc. primum maritum. So the ellipsis might be supplied. <i>Ultra</i>
here is equivalent to <i>longior</i> in the next clause, as T. often puts the
adverb in place of the adjective, whether qualifying or predicate.</p>

<p id="id00428"><i>Ne tanquam—ament</i>, sc. maritum: <i>that they may not love</i> a husband
<i>merely as a husband but as</i> they love <i>the married state</i>. See this and
similar examples of <i>brachylogy</i> well illustrated in Döderlein's Essay on
the style of Tacitus, H. p. 14. Since but one marriage was allowed, all
their love for the married state must be concentrated in one husband.</p>

<p id="id00429"><i>Numerum—finire</i>. In any way contrary to nature and by design. Gün. <i>Quod
fiebat etiam abortus procuratione</i>. K.</p>

<p id="id00430"><i>Ex agnatis. Agnati</i> hoc loco dicuntur, qui <i>post familiam constitutam</i>,
ubi haeres jam est, <i>deinde nascuntur</i>. Hess. To put such to death was a
barbarous custom among the Romans. Cf. Ann. 3, 25; see Beck. Gall. Exc.
2. scene 1.</p>

<p id="id00431"><i>Alibi</i>, e.g. at Rome.—<i>Boni mores</i> vs. <i>bonae leges</i>. These words
involve a sentiment of great importance, and of universal application.
Good habits wherever they exist, and especially in a republic, are of far
greater value and efficacy than good laws.</p>

<p id="id00432" style="margin-top: 2em">XX. <i>Nudi</i>. Cf. 6: nudi aut sagulo leves. Not literally naked, but
slightly clad, cf. Sen. de benef. 5, 13: qui <i>male vestitum</i> et pannosum
vidit, <i>nudum</i> se vidisse dicit.</p>

<p id="id00433"><i>Sordidi</i>. Gün. understands this of personal filth. But this is
inconsistent with the daily practice of bathing mentioned, § 22. It
doubtless refers to the <i>dress</i>, as Gr. and K. understand it: <i>nudi ac
sordidi==poorly and meanly clad</i>. So also Or.</p>

<p id="id00434"><i>Quae miramur</i>. Cf. 4: <i>magna corpora</i>. See also Caes. B.G. 1, 39, 4, 1.
On <i>haec</i>, see note, 3: <i>haec quoque</i>.</p>

<p id="id00435"><i>Ancillis ac nutricibus</i>. So in the Dial. de Clar. Orat., T. animadverts
upon the custom here obliquely censured: nunc natus infans delegatur
Graeculae alicui ancillae. In the early ages of Roman History it was not
so, see Becker's Gall. Exc. 2. scene 1.—<i>Delegantur. Delegamus</i>, quum,
quod <i>ipsi</i> facere debebamus, id per <i>alterum</i> fieri curamus. E.</p>

<p id="id00436"><i>Separet</i>. For the use of the subj. pres. after <i>donec</i>, see note, 1.
<i>erumpat.—Agnoscat</i>==faciat ut agnoscatur. So Död., Gün. and K. But it
is better with Gr., to regard the expression as poetical, and <i>virtus</i>,
as personified: <i>and valor acknowledge</i> them, sc. as brave men and
therefore by implication free born.</p>

<p id="id00437"><i>Venus</i>==concubitus.—<i>Pubertas</i>==facultas generandi. Gr. Cf. Caes, B.G.
6, 21: qui diutissime impuberes permanserunt maximam inter suos ferunt
laudem.</p>

<p id="id00438"><i>Virgines festinantur</i>==nuptiae virginum festinantur, poetice. The words
properare, festinare, accelerare are used in both a trans. and intrans.
sense, cf. Hist. 2, 82: festinabantur; 3, 37: festinarentur. Among the
Romans, boys of fourteen contracted marriage with girls of twelve. Cf.
Smith's Dic. Ant.</p>

<p id="id00439"><i>Eadem, similis, pares</i>. The comparison is between the youth of the two
sexes at the time of marriage; they marry at the same age, equal in
stature and equal in strength. Marriages unequal in these respects, were
frequent at Rome.—<i>Pares—miscentur</i>. Plene: pares paribus, validae
validis miscentur. On this kind of brachylogy, see further in Död. Essay
on style of T., H. p. 15. <i>Miscentur</i> has a middle sense, as the passive
often has, particularly in Tacitus. Cf. note 21: <i>obligantur</i>.</p>

<p id="id00440"><i>Referunt</i>. Cf. Virg. Aen. 4, 329: parvulus Aeneas, qui te tamen ore
<i>referret</i>. See note, 39: auguriis.</p>

<p id="id00441"><i>Ad patrem</i>. <i>Ad</i> is often equivalent to <i>apud</i> in the best Latin
authors; e.g. Cic. ad Att. 10, 16: ad me fuit==apud me fuit. Rhenanus by
conjecture wrote <i>apud</i> patrem to correspond with apud avunculum. But
Passow restored <i>ad</i> with the best reason. For T. prefers <i>different</i>
words and constructions in antithetic clauses. Perhaps also a different
sense is here intended from that which would have been expressed by
<i>apud</i>. Wr. takes <i>ad</i> in the sense, <i>in respect to: as in respect to a
father</i>, i.e. as they would have, if he were their father.</p>

<p id="id00442"><i>Exigunt</i>, sc. hunc nexum==sororum filios.</p>

<p id="id00443"><i>Tanquam</i>. Like Greek os to denote the views of others, not of the
writer. Hence followed by the subj. H. 531; Z. 571.</p>

<p id="id00444"><i>Et in animum</i>. <i>In</i>==quod attinet ad, <i>in respect to</i>. The commonly
received text has <i>ii et animum</i>, which is a mere conjecture of Rhen.
According to K., <i>teneant</i> has for its subject not <i>sororum filii</i>, but
the same subject as <i>exigunt</i>. Render: <i>Since, as they suppose, both in
respect to the mind</i> (the affections), <i>they hold it more strongly, and
in respect to the family, more extensively</i>.</p>

<p id="id00445"><i>Heredes</i> properly refers to property, <i>successores</i> to rank, though the
distinction is not always observed.—<i>Liberi</i> includes both sons and
daughters.</p>

<p id="id00446"><i>Patrui</i>, paternal uncles; <i>avunculi</i>, maternal.</p>

<p id="id00447"><i>Propinqui</i>, blood relations; <i>affines</i>, by marriage.</p>

<p id="id00448"><i>Orbitatis pretia</i>. <i>Pretia==proemia</i>. <i>Orbitatis==childlessness</i>. Those
who had no children, were courted at <i>Rome</i> for the sake of their
property. Vid. Sen. Consol. ad Marc. 19: in civitate nostra, plus gratiae
orbitas confert, quam eripit. So Plutarch de Amore Prolis says: the
childless are entertained by the rich, courted by the powerful, defended
gratuitously by the eloquent: many, who had friends and honors in
abundance, have been stripped of both by the birth of a single child.</p>
