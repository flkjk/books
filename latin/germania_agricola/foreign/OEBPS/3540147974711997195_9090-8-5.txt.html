  <body class="x-ebookmaker"><p id="id01011"><i>Veteranorum colonia</i>. Camolodunum. Ann. 12, 32. Now Colchester. Dr.—<i>Et
reges. Kings also</i>, i.e. besides other means.—<i>Ut vetere</i>, etc. So in
the MSS. and earliest editions. Rhenanus transferred <i>ut</i> to the place
before <i>haberet</i> which it occupies in the common editions. But no change
is necessary. Render: <i>that in accordance with their established custom,
the Roman people might have kings also as the instruments of reducing</i>
(the Britons) <i>to slavery</i>.</p>

<p id="id01012"><i>Didius Gallus</i>. Cf. Ann. 12, 40: arcere hostem satis habebat.—<i>Parta a
prioribus. The acquisitions (conquests) of his predecessors</i>.</p>

<p id="id01013"><i>Aucti officii. Of enlarging the boundaries of his government. Officium</i>
is used in a like sense, Caes. B.C. 3, 5: Toti officio maritimo
praepositus, etc. So Wr.; Or. and Död. understand by it <i>going beyond</i>
the mere performance of his <i>duty</i>. It was his duty to protect his
province: he enlarged it.—<i>Quaereretur</i>. Subj. in a relative clause
denoting a purpose. H. 500; Z. 567.</p>

<p id="id01014"><i>Veranius</i>. Ann. 14, 29.—<i>Paullinus</i>. Ann. 14, 29-30.</p>

<p id="id01015"><i>Monam insulam</i>. Now Anglesey. But the <i>Mona</i> of <i>Caesar</i> is the Isle of
Man, called by Pliny <i>Monapia</i>. The Mona of T. was the chief seat of the
Druids, hence <i>ministrantem vires rebellibus</i>, for the Druids animated
and led on the Briton troops to battle. T. has given (Ann. 14, 30) a very
graphic sketch of the mixed multitude of armed men, women like furies,
and priests with hands uplifted in prayer, that met Paullinus on his
landing, and, for a time, well nigh paralyzed his soldiers with dismay.
In the same connexion, he speaks also of the human sacrifices and other
barbarous rites, which were practised by our Briton Fathers in honor of
their gods.</p>

<p id="id01016" style="margin-top: 2em">XV. <i>Interpretando. By putting their own</i>, i.e. <i>the worst construction
upon them</i>.</p>

<p id="id01017"><i>Ex facili</i>==facile. A frequent form of expression in T., ad Graecorum
consuetudinem. Dr. See R. Exc. 24.</p>

<p id="id01018"><i>Singulos—binos</i>. Distributives==<i>one for each tribe—two for each
tribe</i>.</p>

<p id="id01019"><i>Aeque—aeque</i>. Like Greek correlatives; alike fatal to their subjects
in <i>either case</i>. So [Greek: homoios men] and [Greek: homoios de], Xen.
Mem. 1, 6, 13; Plat. Symp. 181. C.</p>

<p id="id01020"><i>Alterius manus centuriones, alterius servos</i>. This is the reading of the
latest editions (Dr. Wr. Or. and R.), and the best MSS., though the MSS.
differ somewhat: <i>Centurions, the hands</i> (instruments) <i>of the one, and
servants</i>, the hands <i>of the other, added insult to injury</i>. For the use
of <i>manus</i> in the above sense, reference is made to Cic. in Ver. 2, 10,
27: Comites illi tui delecti <i>manus</i> erant tuae. So the <i>centurions</i> of
the <i>legate</i> and the <i>servants</i> of the <i>procurator</i> are said by our
author to have robbed the Briton King Prasutagus of his kingdom and his
palace, Ann. 14, 31, which is the best commentary on the passage before
us.</p>

<p id="id01021"><i>Ab ignavis. By</i> the feeble and cowardly. Antithetic to <i>fortiorem. In
battle, it is the braver that plunders us; but now</i> (it is a special
aggravation of our sufferings, that) <i>by the feeble and cowardly</i>, &amp;c. So
in contempt, they call the veterans, cf. 14: <i>veteranorum colonia</i>; 32:
<i>senum colonia</i>.</p>

<p id="id01022"><i>Tantum</i> limits <i>pro patria</i>; as if it was for their <i>country</i> only they
knew not how to die.</p>

<p id="id01023"><i>Si sese</i>, etc., i.e. in <i>comparison</i> with their own numbers.</p>

<p id="id01024"><i>Patriam—parentes</i>, sc. <i>causas belli esse</i>.</p>

<p id="id01025"><i>Recessisset</i>. Observe the subj. in the subordinate clauses of the oratio
obliqua throughout this chapter. H. 531; Z. 603.</p>

<p id="id01026"><i>Neve—pavescerant</i>. This verb would have been an imperative in the
oratio recta, Z. 603, c. <i>Neve</i> is appropriate either to the imp. or the
subj.</p>

<p id="id01027" style="margin-top: 2em">XVI. <i>Instincti</i>, i.e. furore quodam afflati. Dr. For a fuller account
of this revolt, see Ann. 14, 31-38; Dio. 62, 1-13.</p>

<p id="id01028"><i>Boudicea</i>. Wife of Prasutagus, king of the Iceni. When conquered, she
ended her life by poison, Ann. 14, 37.</p>

<p id="id01029"><i>Expugnatis praesidiis. Having stormed the fortresses</i>. The force of <i>ex</i>
in this word is seen in that it denotes the <i>actual carrying</i> of a place
by assault, whereas <i>oppugnatus</i> only denotes the assault itself. So
[Greek: ek-poliorkaetheis]==<i>taken</i> in a siege, [Greek:
poliorkaetheis]==besieged.</p>

<p id="id01030"><i>Ipsam coloniam</i>. Cf. note 14: veteranorum colonia.</p>

<p id="id01031"><i>In barbaris</i>==qualis inter barbaros esse solet. R. Exc. 25.</p>

<p id="id01032"><i>Ira et victoria</i>. Hendiadys. Render: <i>Nor did they in the excitement of
victory omit</i>, etc. So Dr. R. and Wr. <i>Ira</i> may, however, refer to their
<i>long cherished resentment. Ira</i> causam, <i>victoria</i> facultatem explendae
saevitiae denotat. Rit.—<i>Quod nisi. And had not</i>, etc. Cf. note, 12:
<i>quod si</i>.</p>

<p id="id01033"><i>Patientiae</i>. Most Latin authors would have said: ad patientiam. R.
<i>Patientia</i> here==<i>submission</i>.</p>

<p id="id01034"><i>Tenentibus—plerisque. Though many still retained</i>, i.e. did not lay
down <i>their arms</i>.</p>

<p id="id01035"><i>Propius</i>. Al. <i>proprius</i>. But that is purely conjectural. Adv. for adj.,
cf. ultra, 8; longe, 6==propior, like the <i>propior cura</i> of Ovid.
Metamor. 13, 578. Render: <i>a more urgent fear</i>. Some would connect
<i>propius</i> with <i>agitabat</i> notwithstanding its remote position.</p>

<p id="id01036"><i>Suae quoque</i>. <i>His own also</i>, sc. as well as that of the Empire.</p>

<p id="id01037"><i>Durius</i>, sc. aequo. H. 444, 1. cf. 4: <i>acrius</i>, note.</p>

<p id="id01038"><i>Delictis—novus</i>. <i>A stranger to their faults</i>. Cf. Sil. Ital. 6, 254:
novusque dolori. Wr. Cf. Böt. Lex. Tac. <i>Dativus</i>.</p>

<p id="id01039"><i>Poenitentiae mitior</i>, i.e. mitior erga poenitentiam, or facilior erga
poenitentes. <i>Poenitentiae</i> dat. of object.</p>

<p id="id01040"><i>Compositis prioribus</i>. <i>Having restored things to their former quiet
state</i>.</p>

<p id="id01041"><i>Nullis—experimentis</i>. <i>Undertaking no military expeditions</i>. Or.—
<i>Castrorum</i>. Cf. 5, note.</p>

<p id="id01042"><i>Comitate—tenuit</i>. "<i>Retained the province by a popular manner of
administering the government</i>." Ky.—<i>Curandi</i>. Note, H. 1, 52.</p>

<p id="id01043"><i>Ignoscere</i>. Properly <i>not to notice</i>, hence <i>to view with indulgence, to
indulge in</i>.</p>

<p id="id01044"><i>Vitiis blandientibus</i>. The reference is to the <i>luxurious and vicious
pleasures</i> of the Romans, which enervated the Britons, cf. 21, at close,
where the idea is brought out more fully.</p>

<p id="id01045"><i>Cum—lasciviret</i>. <i>Cum==since</i>. Hence the subj.</p>

<p id="id01046"><i>Precario</i>. Cf. note, G. 44.—<i>Mox</i>, cf. note 4.</p>

<p id="id01047"><i>Velut pacti</i> implies a <i>tacit</i> compact. It was understood between them,
that the army were to enjoy their liberty; the general, his life. Supply
<i>sunt</i> with <i>pacti</i>. Död. and Wr. supply <i>essent</i>; but they read <i>haec</i>
for <i>et</i> before <i>seditio</i> contrary to the best MSS.</p>

<p id="id01048"><i>Et seditio</i>. <i>Et==and so</i>. Al. haec seditio.</p>

<p id="id01049"><i>Stetit</i>. Not stopped, but stood, as in our phrase: stood them in so
much. So Ovid: Multo <i>sanguine</i>—victoria <i>stetit</i>. And T. His. 3, 53:
Majore <i>damno</i>—veteres civium discordias reipublicae <i>stetisse</i>. Render:
<i>cost no blood</i>. Dr.</p>

<p id="id01050"><i>Petulantia</i>. <i>Insubordination</i>.—<i>Nisi quod</i>, but, cf. 6.</p>

<p id="id01051"><i>Bolanus</i>. If the reader wishes to know more of the officers named in
this chapter, for Turpilianus, see Ann. 14, 39. His. 1, 6; Trebellius,
His. 1, 60; Bolanus, Ann. 15, 3. His. 2, 65. 79.</p>

<p id="id01052"><i>Caritatem—auctoritatis</i>. "<i>Had conciliated affection as a substitute
for authority</i>." Ky.</p>

<p id="id01053" style="margin-top: 2em">XVII. <i>Recuperavit</i>. Al. <i>reciperavit</i>. The two forms are written
indiscriminately in the MSS. The word may express either the recovery of
what was lost, or the restoration to health of what was diseased. Either
would make a good sense here. Cf. chap. 5; also Cic. Phil. 14, 13:
<i>republica recuperata</i>. Or. renders <i>acquired again</i>, sc. what had
previously belonged, as it were, to him, rather than to the bad emperors
who had preceded him.</p>

<p id="id01054"><i>Petilius Cerialis</i>. Cf. note, 8.—<i>Brigantum</i>. Cf. H. 3, 45; Ann. 12,
32. Their territory embraced Cumberland, Westmoreland, Lancashire, Durham
and Yorkshire.</p>

<p id="id01055"><i>Aut victoria aut bello</i>, i.e. <i>either received their submission after
the victory, or involved them in the calamities of war</i>. <i>Aut—aut</i>
generally adversative==either—or on the contrary. <i>Vel—vel</i> only
disjunctive==whether—or. Cf. note on vel—vel, G. 15.</p>

<p id="id01056"><i>Alterius</i>. Another, than Julius Frontinus, i.e. by implication, one
<i>different</i> from him, <i>less brave and great</i>. Cf. His. 2, 90: tanquam
apud alterius civitatis senatum; 3, 13, note. <i>Alius</i> is the word usually
appropriated to express this idea. <i>Alter</i> generally implies a
<i>resemblance</i> between contrasted objects. See Freund, ad v.</p>

<p id="id01057"><i>Obruisset—sustinuit</i>. These words primarily refer to physical energies,
and are exactly counterpart==<i>crushed—sustained</i>.</p>

<p id="id01058"><i>Quantum licebat</i> limits <i>vir magnus: as great a man, as it was
permitted</i> him to be, restricted as he was in his resources, perhaps by
the parsimony of the Emperor. On Julius Frontinus, cf. H. 4, 39. He was
the friend of Pliny the Younger (Plin. Ep. 9, 19) and therefore probably
of Tacitus. His books on Stratagems, and on the Aqueducts of Rome are
still extant.—<i>Super</i>, over and above, i.e. <i>besides</i>.</p>

<p id="id01059" style="margin-top: 2em">XVIII. <i>Agentem</i>, sc. excubias or stationem==stationed in, cf. His. 1,
47: copias, quae Lugduni agebant. <i>Ala</i>. Cf. note, H. 1, 54.</p>

<p id="id01060"><i>Ordovicum civitas</i>. Situated over against the Island Mona, north of the
Silures, i.e. in the northern part of what is now Wales.</p>

<p id="id01061"><i>Ad—verterentur</i>. <i>Were turning themselves</i> (middle sense) <i>towards</i>,
i.e. <i>looking to or for. Occasionem. An opportunity</i>, sc. to attack the
Romans in their security. Al. <i>uterentur</i>.</p>

<p id="id01062"><i>Quibus—erat. They who wished for war</i>. Greek idiom for qui bellum
volebant. See Kühner's Greek Gram. 284, 10, c., cf. His. 3, 43:
volentibus fuit, etc., and note, ibid. In Latin, the idiom occurs chiefly
in Sallust and T. See Z. 420, and H. 387, 3.</p>

<p id="id01063"><i>Ac—opperiri</i>. Al. <i>aut</i> by conjecture. But <i>ac==ac tamen, and yet</i>. Cf.
Ann. 1, 36: <i>exauctorari—ac retineri sub vexillo</i>.</p>

<p id="id01064"><i>Transvecta</i>. Al. transacta. Cf. His. 2, 76: abiit et <i>transvectum est
tempus</i>. Only T. uses the word in reference to time.</p>

<p id="id01065"><i>Numeri</i>==cohortes or manipuli, cf. His. 1, 6: multi numeri. This use of
the word is post-Augustan. Cf. note, His. 1, 6.</p>

<p id="id01066"><i>Tarda et contraria</i>. In appos. with the foregoing clauses==
<i>circumstances calculated to retard and oppose him in commencing war</i>.</p>

<p id="id01067"><i>Plerisque</i>, sc. of the inferior officers. They thought it best that
those parts of the country, whose fidelity was questionable (<i>suspecta</i>)
should be secured by garrisons (<i>custodiri</i>). <i>Potius</i> is an adj. and
goes with <i>videbatur</i>==<i>it seemed preferable</i>.</p>

<p id="id01068"><i>Legionum vexillis</i>. Some understand this of veteran soldiers who had
served out their time (twenty years), but were still <i>sub vexillis</i> (not
dismissed). So R. and W. Others of parts of the legions detached for a
season sub vexillis (under separate standards). So Gronovius. The word
seems to be used in both senses. See note, H. 1, 31.</p>

<p id="id01069"><i>In aequum</i>. Into the plain. Aequus, prim. level, hence aequor, sea.</p>

<p id="id01070"><i>Erexit aciem. Led his troops up the steep</i>. So His. 3, 71: erigunt aciem
per adversum collem.</p>

<p id="id01071"><i>Ac—ceteris. And that according as the first</i> enterprises <i>went</i> (cf.
note, 5: <i>cessit</i>), would be the terror in the rest_ of his engagements.
Cf. H. 2, 20: <i>gnarus, ut initia belli provenissent, famam in cetera
fore</i>. Al. <i>fore universa</i>.</p>

<p id="id01072"><i>Possessione. Taking</i> possession, cf. 14. A <i>possidere</i>, i.e. occupare,
non a <i>possidere</i>, quod est occupatum tenere. Rit. For the abl. without
<i>a</i>, cf. H. 2, 79: <i>Syria remeans</i>.</p>

<p id="id01073"><i>Ut in dubiis consiliis</i>, sc. fieri solet. Generals are not apt to be
prepared beforehand for enterprises, not contemplated at all in their
original plans.</p>

<p id="id01074"><i>Qui—expectabant. Who were looking out for (ex</i> and <i>specto) a fleet,
for ships</i>, in a word <i>for the sea</i>, i.e. naval preparations in general,
instead of an attack by land. The language is highly rhetorical.—
<i>Crediderint</i>. Livy, Nepos and Tacitus use the <i>perf</i>. subj. after <i>ut</i>,
denoting a consequence, when a single, specific past act is expressed;
when a repeated or continued action, the <i>imp</i>. subj. Most writers use
the imp. in both cases. See H. 482, 2, and 480; Z. 516; also Z. 504,
Note, and note H. 1, 24: <i>dederit</i>.</p>

<p id="id01075"><i>Officiorum ambitum. "Compliments of office."</i> Ky.</p>

<p id="id01076"><i>Placuisset</i>. Subj. cf. note, 11: <i>ut quos</i>.</p>

<p id="id01077"><i>Expeditionem—continuisse. He did not call it a campaign or a victory to
have kept the conquered in subjection</i>.</p>

<p id="id01078"><i>Laureatis</i> sc. litteris. It was customary to communicate the news of
victory to the Emperor and Senate, by letters bound with bay leaves, cf.
Liv. 5, 28: <i>litterae</i> a Postumio <i>laureatae</i> sequuntur. Without
<i>litterae</i>, it occurs only here. Or. So in H. 3, 77. T. avoids the
technical expression and employs the word <i>laurea</i>, seldom used in this
sense.</p>

<p id="id01079"><i>Dissimulatione</i>. Cf. note, 6.—<i>Aestimantibus</i>, cf. aestimanti, 11. The
aspiring, and especially the vain, may learn from this passage a lesson
of great practical value. Compare also § 8, at the close.</p>

<p id="id01080" style="margin-top: 2em">XIX. <i>Aliena experimenta. The experience of others</i>.</p>

<p id="id01081"><i>Nihil</i>. Ellipsis of <i>agere</i> (which is inserted without MS. authority in
the common editions). So Cic. Phil. 1, 2: Nihil per senatum, etc. Cf. G.
19: <i>adhuc</i>, note.</p>

<p id="id01082"><i>Ascire</i>, al. accire. <i>To receive into regular service</i>. The reference is
to the transfer of soldiers from the raw recruits to the legions. So W.
followed by Dr. R. and W. The next clause implies, that he took care to
receive into the service none but the best men (<i>optimum quemque</i>), whom
he deemed <i>trustworthy</i> (<i>fidissimum</i>) just in <i>proportion</i> as they were
<i>good</i>. This use of two superlatives mutually related to each other, the
former with <i>quisque</i>, is frequent in Latin and resembles the English use
of two comparatives: the better, the more trustworthy. Cf. Z. 710, b.;
also note, 3: <i>promptissmus quisque</i>.</p>

<p id="id01083"><i>Exsequi</i>==punire. A sense peculiar to the later Latin. Cic. and Caes.
use <i>persequi</i>. For a similar use of the word in the expression of a
similar sentiment, see Suet. Jul. 67: Delicta neque observabat omnia
neque pro modo exsequebatur. Compare our word <i>execute</i>. And mark the
sentiment, as a maxim in the science of government.</p>

<p id="id01084"><i>Severitatem commodare</i>. W. with Dr. and R. make this an example of
zeugma. And in its ordinary acceptation (i.e. in the sense <i>to give</i>)
the word <i>commodare</i> certainly applies only to <i>veniam</i>, and not to
<i>severitatem</i>. But <i>commodare</i> in its primary signification means to
<i>adapt</i>; and in this sense, it suits both of its adjuncts: <i>He adapted</i>
(awarded) <i>pardon to small offences, severe punishment to great ones</i>. So
Wr. For the series of infinitives, cf. notes, 5: <i>nosci</i>, etc.; G. 30:
<i>praeponere</i>, etc.</p>

<p id="id01085"><i>Nec poena—contentus esse. Nor was he always content with punishment,
but oftener with repentance</i>. Mere punishment without reformation did not
satisfy him; reformation without punishment satisfied him better. See
Död. in loc. Here too some have called in the aid of zeugma.</p>

<p id="id01086"><i>Auctionem</i>. Al. exactionem. The former is the reading of the greater
part of the MSS. and the later German editions. <i>Auctionem tributorum</i>
refers to the increased tribute exacted by Vesp. cf. Sueton. Vesp. 16:
<i>auxisse</i> tributa provinciis, nonnullis et <i>duplicasse</i>.</p>

<p id="id01087"><i>Munerum</i>. <i>Duties, burdens.—Circumcisis</i>. Cf. note, 2: expulsis. etc.,
and 11: amissa virtute.</p>

<p id="id01088"><i>Namque—cogebantur</i>. The best version we can give of this obscure
passage is as follows: <i>For they were compelled in mockery to sit by the
closed granaries and to buy corn needlessly</i> (beyond what was necessary,
cf. note on <i>ultro</i>, G. 28, when they had enough of their own) <i>and to
sell it at a fixed price</i> (prescribed by the purchasers). It has been
made a question, whether the granaries of the Britons, or those of the
Romans are here meant. Död., Dr. and R. advocate the former opinion;
Walch, Wr., Or., and Rit. the latter. According to the former view, the
Britons were often obliged to buy corn of the Romans, because they were
forbidden to use their own, to supply themselves and their families;
according to the latter, because they were required (as explained below)
to carry their contributions to a quarter so distant from their own
granaries, that they were fain to buy the corn rather at some nearer
warehouse of the Romans. The selling at a fixed price is equally
intelligible on either supposition. Or. following the best MSS. reads
<i>ludere pretio</i>, which Rit. has amended into <i>colludere pretio</i>. <i>Ultro</i>
may well enough be rendered <i>moreover</i> or <i>even</i>, thus giving emphasis to
<i>emere</i>.</p>

<p id="id01089"><i>Devortia itinerum</i>. <i>Bye roads</i>, explained by <i>avia</i>, as <i>longinquitas</i>
is by <i>remota</i>. The object of requiring the people to convey their
contributions to such distant and inconvenient points, was to compel them
to buy of the Romans, or to pay almost any sum of money to avoid
compliance. The reader of Cic. will remember in illustration of this
whole passage, the various arts to which Verres is said to have had
recourse to enrich himself, at the expense of the people of his province
(Cic. in Ver. 3, 72, and 82), such as refusing to accept the
contributions they brought, obliging them to buy of him at his own price,
requiring them to carry supplies to points most distant and difficult of
access, <i>ut vecturae difficultate ad quam vellent aestimationem
pervenirent</i>.</p>

<p id="id01090"><i>Omnibus</i>, sc. et incolis et militibus; <i>paucis</i>, sc. praefectis aut
publicanis. Dr.</p>

<p id="id01091"><i>Donec—fieret</i>. The subj. here denotes a purpose or object in view, and
theretore follows <i>donec</i> according to the rule. H. 522, II.; Z. 575.
Tacitus however always expresses a repeated past action after <i>donec</i> by
the imp. subj. Cf. note, 37: affectavere; H. 1, 13. 35.</p>

<p id="id01092" style="margin-top: 2em">XX. <i>Statim</i>. Emphatic, like [Greek: euthus]. Cf. Thucyd. 2, 47: [Greek:
tou therous euthus archomenou]: at the <i>very</i> beginning of summer. So in
§ 3.</p>

<p id="id01093"><i>Intolerantia</i>, al. tolerantia, but without MS. authority. <i>Incuria</i> is
<i>negligence</i>. Intolerantia_ is <i>insufferable arrogance, severity</i>, in a
word <i>intolerance</i>. So Cic.: superbia atque intolerantia.</p>

<p id="id01094"><i>Quae—timebatur</i>. And no wonder, since <i>ubi solitudinem</i> faciunt, <i>pacem</i>
appellant, 30.</p>

<p id="id01095"><i>Multus</i>, al. militum. <i>Multus</i> in the recent editions.
<i>Multus</i>==frequens, cf. Sal. Jug. 84: multus ac ferox instare.—
<i>Modestiam—disiectos</i>. These words are antithetic, though one is
abstract and the other concrete. The whole clause may be literally
rendered thus: <i>ever present in the line of march, he commended
good order (discipline), the disorderly he restrained</i>.</p>

<p id="id01096"><i>Popularetur</i>, sc. A. <i>Quominus</i>, that not==<i>but: but he ravaged their
country by unexpected invasions</i>.</p>

<p id="id01097"><i>Irritamenta</i>. <i>Inducements.—Pacis</i>. Ang. <i>to</i> or <i>for peace</i>.</p>

<p id="id01098"><i>Ex aequo egerant</i>, lit. had acted (lived) on an equality, i.e. <i>had
maintained their independence</i>, cf. His. 4, 64: aut ex aequo agetis aut
aliis imperitabitis.</p>

<p id="id01099"><i>Iram posuere</i>. Cf. Hor. Ars Poet.: et <i>iram</i> colligit ac <i>ponit</i> temere.
See also G. 27: ponunt dolorem, etc.</p>

<p id="id01100"><i>Ut—transierit</i>. The clause is obscure. The best that can be made of it
is this: <i>they were encompassed by forts and garrisons with so much skill
and care that no part of Britain hitherto now went over</i> (to the enemy)
<i>with impunity</i> (literally unattacked). For the meaning of <i>nova</i>, cf.
22. For <i>transierit</i>, cf. <i>transitio</i>, H. 2, 99; 3, 61; and Freund, sub
v. This is Walther's interpretation. If, with Ernesti, Dr. and some
others, we might suppose a <i>sic</i>, <i>ita</i> or <i>tam</i> to be understood with
<i>illacessita</i>, we might obtain perhaps a better sense, viz. <i>came over</i>
(to the Romans) <i>with so little annoyance</i> (from the enemy). In the last
edition a meaning was attached to <i>transierit</i> (<i>remained</i>, sc.
unattacked), for which I now find no sufficient authority. Among the many
amendments, which have been suggested, the easiest and best is that of
Susius, followed by Wexius, Dübner, Or. and Rit, viz. placing
<i>Illacessita transiit</i> at the beginning of the next chapter. But this
does violence not only to MS. authority, but to Latin usage in making the
adverb <i>ut, so as, as</i>, follow <i>tanta</i>. In such a connection, <i>ut</i> must
be a conjunction==<i>so that, that</i>. See Freund sub v. For the <i>perf</i>.

<p id="id01101"><i>Praesidiis castellisque</i>. Gordon, in his Itinerarium Septentrionale,
found more remains of Roman works in that part of Britain here referred
to, than in any other portion of the Island.</p>

<p id="id01102" style="margin-top: 2em">XXI. <i>Ut—assuescerent</i>. <i>In order that they might become habituated</i>,
etc.—<i>In bella faciles. Easily inclined to wars</i>. Cf. Ann. 14, 4:
<i>facili ad gaudia</i>. Al. <i>in bello, bello</i>, and <i>in bellum</i>.—<i>Otio</i>. See
note, 11: otio.—<i>Privatim. As a private individual; publice, by public
authority, and of course from the public treasury</i>, cf. note G. 39:
publice.—<i>Jam vero</i>. <i>Moreover</i>, cf. G. 14, note.</p>

<p id="id01103"><i>Anteferre</i>. Wr. takes this word in its primary sense==bear before, i.e.
carry beyond: <i>he carried (advanced) the native talents of the Britons
beyond the learning of the Gauls</i>. But there is no authority for such a
use of the word, when followed by the acc. and dat. It is doubtless used
in its more ordinary sense; and the <i>preference</i> which A. expressed for
the genius of the Britons over the learning of the Gauls, <i>stimulated</i>
them to greater exertions. It is somewhat curious to observe thus early
that mutual emulation and jealousy, which has marked the whole history of
Britain and France. The national vanity of La Bletterie is sorely wounded
by this remark of T. See his note in loco, also Murphy's.—<i>Toga</i>. Cf.
note on <i>togatos</i>, 9.</p>

<p id="id01104"><i>Ut—concupiscerent</i>. <i>Ut==so that</i>, denoting a consequence. The verb
here denotes a continued or habitual state of mind. Hence the <i>imp</i>.

<p id="id01107"><i>Humanitas. Civilisation, refinement</i>. Compare the professorships of
<i>humanity</i> in European Universities.</p>

<p id="id01108"><i>Pars servitutis</i>. For the sentiment, cf. His. 4, 64: voluptatibus,
quibus Romani plus adversus subjectos, quam armis valent. <i>Cum==while,

<p id="id01109" style="margin-top: 2em">XXII. <i>Tertius—annus</i>. <i>Third campaign</i>.</p>

<p id="id01110"><i>Taum</i>. The Frith of Tay.—<i>Nationibus</i>. Here synonymous with <i>gentes</i>;
sometimes less comprehensive, cf. note, G. 2.</p>

<p id="id01111"><i>Pactione ac fuga</i>. Al. <i>aut</i> fuga, but without authority. There are
but two distinct clauses marked by <i>aut—aut: either taken by assault or
abandoned by capitulation and flight</i>.</p>

<p id="id01112"><i>Nam—firmabantur</i>. This clause assigns a reason, why the Romans were
<i>able</i> to make frequent sorties (<i>crebrae eruptiones</i>), viz. supplies of
provision so abundant, as to be proof against blockade.</p>

<p id="id01113"><i>Moras obsidionis. A protracted siege</i>, or <i>blockade</i>.</p>

<p id="id01114"><i>Annuis copiis. Supplies for a year</i>. This is the <i>primary</i> signification
of <i>annuus</i>; that of our word <i>annual</i> is <i>secondary</i>.</p>

<p id="id01115"><i>Intrepida—praesidio</i>==hiberna quieta ac tuta ab hostibus. Fac. and For.
—<i>Irritis, baffled</i>. Seldom applied to <i>persons</i> by prose writers. Cf. H.
4, 32.</p>

<p id="id01116"><i>Pensare</i>. R. remarks a peculiar fondness in T. for the use of the simple
verb instead of the compound, e.g. missa for omissa, sistens for
resistens, flammare for inflammare, etc. So here <i>pensare==compensare</i>.
Cf. 12: <i>trahuntur</i>, note.</p>

<p id="id01117"><i>Avidus</i>, sc. laudis==per aviditatem laudis et gloriae. E.: A. never in
his eagerness for glory arrogated to himself the honor of the
achievements of others.—<i>Seu—seu. Every one, whether centurion or
praefect</i> (commander of a legion, cf. note, H. 1, 82.), <i>was sure to have
in him an impartial witness to his deeds</i>.</p>

<p id="id01118"><i>Acerbior</i>, cf. note on <i>durius</i>, 16.—<i>Apud quosdam</i>==a quibusdam.</p>

<p id="id01119"><i>Secretum et silentium. Reserve and silence</i>. So W. and Ky. But R. and
Dr.: <i>private interviews</i> (to be summoned to which by some commanders was
alarming), <i>and neglect of the usual salutations in public</i> (which was
also often a token of displeasure on the part of a superior officer). The
former is the more simple and obvious, though it must be confessed that
the latter is favored by the usus loquendi of T., in regard especially to
<i>secretum</i>, cf. 39; Ann. 3, 8, where <i>secreto</i> is opposed to <i>palam</i>; and
His. 4, 49: incertum, quoniam <i>secreto eorum</i> nemo <i>adfuit</i>.</p>

island, as described in the sequel. See Or. in loc.</p>

<p id="id01121"><i>Clota et Bodotria</i>. Frith of Clyde and Frith of Forth.</p>

<p id="id01122"><i>Revectae</i>, i.e. the natural current being driven back by the tide from
the sea on either side. <i>Angusto—spatio</i>. It is now cut across by a ship
canal.</p>

<p id="id01123"><i>Propior sinus</i>==peninsula on the south side of the Friths, cf, note on
sinus G. 1, and 29. Sinus refers particularly to the <i>curved border</i> on
<i>this side</i> the aestuaries. This border (wherever the friths were so
narrow as to require it), as well as the narrow isthmus, was occupied and
secured (<i>tenebatur</i>) by garrisons.</p>

<p id="id01124" style="margin-top: 2em">XXIV. <i>Nave prima</i>. The first Roman ship that ever visited those shores.
So Br., Dr., etc. <i>The foremost ship</i>, sc., A. himself, followed by
others in a line. So Ritter. Wr., and some others understand it of a
voyage from <i>Rome</i>, where they suppose him to have passed the winter, and
whence he crossed over to Britain by the <i>earliest</i> vessel in the spring.
W. and R. make <i>prima</i> equivalent to an adv. and render: crossing over
<i>for the first time</i> by ship. Or. also makes <i>prima==tum primum</i>.</p>

<p id="id01125"><i>Copiis</i>. Here troops with their equipments==<i>forces</i>, cf. 8: majoribus
copiis.—<i>Medio sita</i> lying between, not midway between. E.—<i>In spem—
formidinem</i>. More with the hope of invading Ireland, than through fear of
invasion by the Irish.—<i>Valentissimam partem</i>, viz. Gaul, Spain and
Britain.</p>

<p id="id01126"><i>Miscuerit</i>. The subj. here denotes the aim or purpose of the projector:
it would have done so <i>in his view</i>.</p>

<p id="id01127"><i>Invicem</i>==an adj. <i>mutual.—Nostri maris</i>. The Mediterranean.</p>

<p id="id01128"><i>Differunt: in melius</i>. The authorities differ greatly as to the reading,
the pointing and the interpretation of this passage. Some copies omit
<i>in</i>. Others insert <i>nec</i> before it. Some place the pause before <i>in
melius</i>, others after. Some read <i>differt</i>, others <i>differunt. Nec in
melius</i> would perhaps give the better sense. But the reading is purely
conjectural. I have given that, which, on the whole, seems to rest on the
best authority, and to make the best sense. The sense is: <i>the soil,
climate, &amp;c., do not differ much from those of Britain. But that the
harbors and entrances to the country are better</i> (lit. <i>differ for the
better, differre in melius), is ascertained through the medium of the
merchants, who resort thither for trade</i> (for Ireland had not yet, like
Britain, been explored by a Roman <i>army</i>). So Wr. and Död. On <i>in
melius</i>, see note H. 1, 18. Or. and Rit. make the comparison thus: the
harbors and entrances are better known, than the soil, climate, &amp;c. The
common interpretation is: the harbors, &amp;c., of Ireland are better known,
than those of Britain. But neither of these interpretations accounts for
the position of <i>melius</i>; and the last is in itself utterly incredible.</p>

<p id="id01129"><i>Ex eo</i>, sc. A. Pass. and Dr. understand it of the Irish chief, and infer
that T. had been in Brit. But A. is the subject of the next sentence
without the repetition of his name, as it would have been repeated, if
this sentence referred to another.</p>

<p id="id01130" style="margin-top: 2em">XXV. <i>Amplexus</i>. Some supply <i>bello</i>, as in 17: bello amplexus. But
better: embracing <i>in his plan of operations</i>, i.e. <i>extending his
operations to those tribes</i>.</p>

<p id="id01131"><i>Hostilis exercitus</i>. Al. hostili exercitu. But <i>hostilis exercitus</i> in
the MSS. and earliest editions.—<i>Infesta</i> is here active: <i>hostile
inroads of the enemy's forces</i>.</p>

<p id="id01132"><i>In partem virium</i>. <i>For</i>, i.e. <i>as a part of his force</i>.</p>

<p id="id01133"><i>Impelleretur</i>, was borne on with rapid and resistless power.</p>

<p id="id01134"><i>Profunda—adversa</i>. Cf. note, 6: <i>inania honoris</i>.</p>

<p id="id01135"><i>Mixti copiis et laetitia. Uniting their stores and their pleasures</i>,
i.e. their respective means of entertainment. For <i>mixti</i>, cf. 4:
locum—mixtum. For <i>copiis</i> in this sense, 22: annuis copiis. For the
other sense, viz. forces, 24: copiis, note.</p>

<p id="id01136"><i>Hinc—hinc==on this side—on that</i>. Cf. note G. 14: <i>illum—illam</i>.—
<i>Victus</i>. Al. <i>auctus</i>.</p>

<p id="id01137"><i>Ad manus et arma</i>. Ang. <i>to arms</i>.</p>

<p id="id01138"><i>Oppugnasse</i> depends on <i>fama</i>. Their preparations were great. Rumor as
usual (<i>uti mos</i>, etc.) represented them still greater; for the rumor
went abroad, that the Caledonians had <i>commenced offensive operations
(oppugnasse ultra).—Castella adorti</i> is the means by which they <i>metum
addiderant</i>, i.e. <i>had inspired additional fear</i>.</p>

<p id="id01139"><i>Pluribus agminibus. In several divisions</i>. Accordingly it is added:
<i>diviso et ipse</i>, A. <i>himself also</i>, i.e. as well as the Britons,
<i>having divided</i>, etc.</p>

<p id="id01140"><i>Agmen</i> (from ago), properly a body of men on the march.—<i>Exercitus</i>,
under military drill (exerceo.)</p>

<p id="id01141" style="margin-top: 2em">XXVI. <i>Quod ubi</i>, etc. <i>When this was known</i>, etc. Latin writers, as well
as Greek, generally link their sentences, chapters, &amp;c., more closely
together, than English. Hence we are often obliged to render their
relative by our demonstrative. See Z. 803. <i>Ubi</i>, here adv. of <i>time</i>, as
in 20, 38, et passim.</p>

<p id="id01142"><i>Certabant</i>. Not <i>fought</i> with the enemy, but <i>vied</i> with each other. So
below: utroque—certante. Hence followed by <i>de</i> gloria, not <i>pro</i> gloria,
which some would substitute for it; <i>secure for</i> (in regard to) <i>safety,
they vied with each other in respect to</i> (or <i>in</i>) <i>glory</i>. With <i>pro
salute</i>, cf. His. 4, 58: pro me securior.</p>

<p id="id01143"><i>Erupere. Sallied forth</i>, sc. from the camp.</p>

<p id="id01144"><i>Utroque exercitu</i>. Each of the two <i>Roman</i> armies.</p>

<p id="id01145"><i>Quod</i>. Cf. 12, note.—<i>Debellatum</i>, lit. the war would have been fought
<i>out</i>, i.e. <i>ended</i>.</p>

<p id="id01146" style="margin-top: 2em">XXVII. <i>Cujus</i> refers to <i>victoria</i> in the previous section (cf. <i>quod</i>
26, note): <i>inspirited by the consciousness and the glory of this
victory</i>.</p>

<p id="id01147"><i>Modo cauti</i>. Compare the sentiment with 25: specie prudentium, etc.</p>

<p id="id01148"><i>Arte—rati</i>, al. arte <i>usos</i> rati by conjecture. But T. is fond of such
ellipses: <i>The Britons, thinking it was not by superior bravery, but by
favoring circumstances</i> (on the part of the Romans) <i>and the skill of
their commander</i> (sc. that they had been defeated). Rit. reads
<i>superati</i>.</p>

<p id="id01149"><i>Utrimque</i>. Both the Romans and the Britons; the Romans excited by their
victory, the Britons by their coetibus ac sacrificiis.</p>

<p id="id01150"><i>Discessum. They separated</i>, viz. after the battle and at the close of
the campaign.</p>

<p id="id01151" style="margin-top: 2em">XXVIII. <i>Cohors Usipiorum</i>. See same story, Dio Cass. 66, 20.</p>

<p id="id01152"><i>Adactis. Forced on board.—Remiganto</i>==gubernante, to avoid sameness,
with <i>gubernatoribus</i>, Br. R. supposes that having but one pilot left,
only the vessel on which he sailed was <i>rowed</i>, while the others were
towed by it; and this rowing <i>under his direction</i> is ascribed to <i>him</i>.
Some MSS. and many editions read <i>remigrante</i>, which some translate:
<i>making his escape</i>, and others connect with <i>interfectis</i>, and suppose
that he also was slain in trying to <i>bring back</i> his boat to shore.
Whether we read <i>remigante</i> or <i>remigrante</i>, the signification of either
is unusual.</p>

<p id="id01153"><i>Praevehebantur</i>. Sailed along the coast (in sight of land).</p>

<p id="id01154"><i>Inopiae</i> is governed by <i>eo</i>, which is the old dat.==<i>to such a degree.
—Ad extremum==at last</i>.</p>

<p id="id01155"><i>Vescerentur</i> followed by the acc. H. 419, 4. 1; Z. 466. For the imp.
subj. cf. note 21: <i>ut—concupiscerent</i>.</p>

<p id="id01156"><i>Amissis—navibus</i>. This is regarded by some as proof that <i>all</i> the
steersmen were slain or escaped. Dr. answers, that it may refer only to
the <i>two</i> ships that were without steersmen.</p>

<p id="id01157"><i>Suevis</i>. A people of Northern Germany (G. 38, seq.) whither, after
having circumnavigated Britain, the Usipii came.—<i>Mox, subsequently</i>,
some having escaped the Suevi.</p>

<p id="id01158"><i>Per commercia. In trade</i>, cf. same in 39.</p>

<p id="id01159"><i>Nostram ripam</i>. The Gallic bank of the Rhine, which was the border of
the Roman Empire, cf. G. passim.</p>

<p id="id01160"><i>Quos—indicium—illustravit</i>. Whom the account of so wonderful an
adventure rendered illustrious. The rule would require the subj. H. 501,
I. 2; Z. 561.</p>

<p id="id01161" style="margin-top: 2em">XXIX. <i>Initio aestatis</i>, i.e. in the beginning of the <i>next</i> summer (the
7th campaign, cf. 25: <i>aestate, qua sextum</i>, etc.), as the whole history
shows. See especially <i>proximo anno</i>, 34. Hence the propriety of
commencing a new section here. The common editions begin it below:
<i>Igitur</i>, etc.</p>

<p id="id01162"><i>Plerique</i>. Cf. note on it, 1.—<i>Fortium virorum</i>. <i>Military men</i>.</p>

<p id="id01163"><i>Ambitiose, with affected fortitude, stoically</i>.—<i>Rursus</i>==contra, <i>on
the contrary</i>, showing the antith. between <i>ambitiose</i> and <i>per lamenta</i>.
—<i>Per lamenta</i>, cf. 6: per caritatem.—<i>Igitur</i>, cf. 13, note.</p>

<p id="id01164"><i>Quae—faceret</i>==ut ea faceret. H. 500; Z. 567. <i>Incertum</i> is explained
by <i>pluribus locis</i>. Render: <i>general alarm</i>.—<i>Expedito</i>==sine
impedimentis, armis solis instructo. Fac. and For.—<i>Montem Grampium</i>.
Now <i>Grampian hills</i>.</p>

<p id="id01165"><i>Cruda—senectus</i>. Cf. Virg. Aen. 6, 304: sed cruda deo viridisque
senectus. <i>Crudus</i> is rarely found in this sense except in the poets.
<i>Crudus</i> properly==bloody (<i>cruor, cruidus</i>); hence the successive
significations, raw, unripe, fresh, vigorous.—<i>Sua decora</i>==praemia
ob virtutem bellicam accepta. E. Any and all <i>badges of distinction</i>,
especially in <i>arms</i>. Wr., Or. and Dõd.</p>

<p id="id01166" style="margin-top: 2em">XXX. <i>Causas belli</i>. Explained by <i>universi servitutis expertes</i> below,
to be the defence of their liberties. In like manner, <i>nostram
necessitatem</i> is explained by <i>nullae ultra terrae</i>: there is no retreat
for us, etc.—<i>Animus, Confidence</i>.</p>

<p id="id01167"><i>Proelium—arma</i>. T. has a passion for <i>pairs</i> of words, especially
nouns, of <i>kindred signification</i>. See examples in Index to Histories;
and in this chapter, <i>spem ac subsidium</i>; <i>recessus ac sinus</i>; <i>obsequiam
ac modestiam</i>.</p>

<p id="id01168"><i>Priores pugnae</i>, sc. in which the Caledonians took no part.—<i>Pugnae</i>
is here, by a figure put for the <i>combatants</i> themselves, who are
represented as looking to the Caledonians, as a kind of corps de reserve,
or last resource.</p>

<p id="id01169"><i>Eo. For that reason</i>. The best things are always kept guarded and
concealed in the <i>penetralia</i>. There may also be a reference to a <i>fact</i>
stated by Caesar (B.G. 5, 12), that the inhabitants of the interior were
aborigines, while those on the coast were immigrants.</p>

<p id="id01170"><i>Terrarum—extremos</i>. <i>The remotest of men and last of freemen</i>.
—<i>Recessus—famae</i>. <i>Our very remoteness and obscurity</i>. This is the
most common and perhaps the most simple translation, making <i>sinus
famae</i>==seclusion in respect to fame. Perhaps, however, it accords as
well with the usual signification of the words, and better with the
connexion and spirit of the speech, to take <i>sinus famae</i> in the sense,
<i>retreat of glory</i>, or <i>glorious retreat</i>. So Wr. His interpretation of
the passage and its connexion is as follows: <i>our very remoteness and our
glorious retreat have guarded us till this day. But now the furthest
extremity of Brit. is laid open</i> (i.e. our retreat is no longer a
safeguard); _and every thing unknown is esteemed great (i.e. this
safeguard also is removed—the Romans in our midst no longer magnify our
strength). Rit. encloses the clause in brackets, as a gloss. He renders
<i>sinus famae, bosom of fame</i>, fame being personified as a goddess. R.,
Dr., Or. make <i>famae</i> dative after <i>defendit</i>==has <i>kept back from fame</i>.</p>

<p id="id01171"><i>Sed nulla jam</i>, etc. But now all the above grounds of confidence—our
remoteness, our glory, our greatness magnified by the imagination of our
enemies, from the very fact that we were unknown to them—all these are
removed; we have none behind us to fall back upon, as our countrymen in
former battles have leaned upon us—and we are reduced to the necessity
of self-defence and self-reliance. The <i>sed</i> seems to be antithetic to
the whole as far back as <i>priores pugnae</i>; whereas <i>nunc</i> is opposed only
to the clause which immediately precedes it, and constitutes an
antithesis within an antithesis.</p>

<p id="id01172"><i>Infestiores</i>, sc. quam fluctus et saxa.</p>

<p id="id01173"><i>Effugeris</i>. Cf. note G. 19: <i>non invenerit</i>; also <i>satiaverit</i> just
below.</p>

<p id="id01174"><i>Et mare</i>. <i>Et==also</i>. Cf. note, G. 11.</p>

<p id="id01175"><i>Opes atque inopiam</i>. Abs. for conc.==rich and poor nations.</p>

<p id="id01176"><i>Falsis nominibus</i> is by some connected with <i>rapere</i>. But better with
<i>appellant</i>. <i>They call things by false names</i>, viz. <i>plunder, empire;
and desolation, peace</i>.</p>

<p id="id01177" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXI. <i>Annos</i>==annonam, <i>yearly produce</i>, cf. G. 14: expectare annum. So
often in the Poets.—<i>In frumentum. For supplies</i>. The reading of this
clause is much disputed. The text follows that of W. and R. and is
approved by Freund. For the meaning of <i>egerunt</i>, cf. <i>praedam
egesserunt</i>, H. 3, 33.</p>

<p id="id01178"><i>Silvis—emuniendis</i>==viis per silvas et paludes muniendis. E.</p>

<p id="id01179"><i>Semel</i>. <i>Once for all</i>, G. 19.—<i>Emit</i>, sc. tributis pendendis;
<i>pascit</i>, sc. frumento praebendo. E.</p>

<p id="id01180"><i>Portus, quibus exercendis</i>. W. and Dr. explain this of collecting
revenue at the ports (i.e. farming them), a thing unknown to the early
Britons; Wr. of rowing, servile labor. Why not refer it to the
<i>construction</i> or <i>improvement</i> of harbors? By rendering <i>exercendis,
working, improving</i>, we make it applicable alike to harbors, mines and
fields.—<i>Reservemur</i>. Subj. in a relative clause denoting a purpose. H.
500; Z. 567.</p>

<p id="id01181"><i>Potuere</i>. Observe the ind., where we use the potential. It is especially
frequent with <i>possum, debeo</i>, &amp;c. Z. 518 and 519.</p>

<p id="id01182"><i>Nonne</i> implies an affirmative answer. Z. 352, and H. 346, II. 1. 2.</p>

<p id="id01183"><i>In poenitentiam</i>, al. in praesentiam. The general idea is essentially
the same with either reading. <i>Non in praesentiam==not to obtain our
freedom, for the present merely. Non in poenitentiam==not about to
obtain our freedom merely to regret it</i>, i.e. in such a manner as the
Brigantes, who forthwith lost it by their <i>socordia</i>.</p>

<p id="id01184" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXII. <i>Nisi si</i>==nisi forte, cf. note, G. 2: nisi si patria.</p>

<p id="id01185"><i>Pudet dictu</i>. The supine after <i>pudet</i> is found only here. Quintilian
however has <i>pudendum dictu</i>. Cf. Or. in loc.; and Z. 441. 443.</p>

<p id="id01186"><i>Commendent</i>, etc. <i>Although they give up their blood to</i> (i.e. <i>shed it
in support of</i>) <i>a foreign tyrant</i>.—<i>Tamen</i> is antithetic to <i>licet</i>:
<i>although</i> they give, <i>yet longer enemies, than slaves</i> (of Rome).</p>

<p id="id01187"><i>Metus—est</i>. <i>It is fear and terror</i> (sc. that keep them in subjection),
<i>weak bonds of affection</i>.</p>

<p id="id01188"><i>Removeris—desierint</i>. Fut. perf. Cf. note, G. 23: <i>indulseris</i>.</p>

<p id="id01189"><i>Nulla—aut alia</i>. Some of the Roman soldiers had lost all attachment to
country and could not be said to have any country; others had one, but it
was not Britain, it was far away.</p>

<p id="id01190"><i>Ne terreat</i>. The third person of the imperative is for the most part
avoided in ordinary language; and the pres. subj. is used in its stead.
Z. 529, Note.</p>

<p id="id01191"><i>Nostras manus</i>, i.e. those ready to join us and aid our arms, viz. (as
he goes on to say), the Gauls and Germans, as well as the Britons now in
the Roman ranks.—<i>Tamquam</i>==<i>just as</i> (<i>tam-quam</i>). Död. renders, <i>just
as certainly as</i>.</p>

<p id="id01192"><i>Vacua.—Destitute of soldiers.—Senum</i>, sc. veterani et emeriti. Cf.
note, 15. <i>Aegra==disaffected</i>. Cf. H. 2, 86.</p>

<p id="id01193"><i>Hic dux</i>, etc. <i>Here a general, here an army</i> (sc. the Roman, awaits
you); <i>there tributes, mines</i>, &amp;c. (and you must conquer the former or
endure the latter—these are your only alternatives).</p>

<p id="id01194"><i>In hoc campo est</i>. <i>Depends on this battle field</i>.—T. has laid out all
his strength on this speech. It can hardly be matched for martial force
and sententious brevity. It breathes, as it should in the mouth of a
Briton, an indomitable spirit of liberty, and reminds us, in many
features, of the concentrated and fiery eloquence, which has so often
roused our American Indians to defend their altars and revenge their
wrongs.</p>

<p id="id01195" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXIII. <i>Ut barbaris moris</i>. Al. et barbari moris. But compare 39: ut
Domitiano moris erat; His. 1, 15: ut moris est. Supply <i>est</i> here: <i>as is
the custom of</i> (lit. <i>to</i>) <i>barbarians</i>. Z. 448, &amp; H. 402, I.</p>

<p id="id01209" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXIV. <i>Hortarer</i>. Literally, <i>I would be exhorting you</i>. The use of the
imperf. subj. in hypothetical sentences, where we should use a plup. (I
would have exhorted you), is frequent both in Greek and Latin, even when
it denotes a <i>complete</i> past action, cf. Z. 525. When the action is not
complete, as here, the Latin form is at once more lively and more exact
than the English.—<i>Proximo anno</i>. This same expression may signify
either the next year, or the last year. Here of course: <i>the last year</i>,
referring to the battle described in 26, cf. also note 29: <i>Initio

<p id="id01210"><i>Furto noctis</i>. Cf. Virg. Aen. 9, 397: fraude noctis.</p>

<p id="id01211"><i>Contra ruere</i>. <i>Rush forth to meet, penetrantibus</i>, etc. R. and Wr. take
<i>ruere</i> for perf. 3d pl. instead of <i>ruerunt</i>, since T. uses the form in
<i>ere</i> much more than that in <i>erunt</i>. Rit. makes it inf. after <i>solet</i>

on this spot</i>, etc. One MS. reads <i>novissime</i> and omits <i>aciem</i>, which
reading is followed in the common editions.</p>

<p id="id01214"><i>Extremo metu</i> is to be closely connected with <i>corpora</i>. For the sense

<p id="id01217"><i>Quinquaginta annis</i>. So many years, it might be said to be in round
numbers, though actually somewhat <i>less</i> than fifty years, since the
dominion of Rome was first established in Britain under the Emperor
Claudius. Cf. 13, supra.—The speech of A. is not equal to that of
Galgacus. He had not so good a cause. He could not appeal to the sacred
principles of justice and liberty, to the love of home and household
gods. But he makes the best of a bad cause. The speech is worthy of a
Roman commander, and touches with masterly skill all those chords in a
Roman soldier's breast, that were never touched in vain.</p>

<p id="id01227" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXVI. <i>Indentibus gladiis</i>, etc. So below: <i>parva scuta</i>, etc. The small
shield and broad sword of the Highlanders.</p>

<p id="id01228"><i>Donec—cohortatus est</i>. Cf. note, G. 37: <i>affectavere</i>.—<i>Batavorum
cohortes</i>. Al. <i>tres—cohortes</i>. But the number is not specified in the
best MSS. In the Histories, eight cohorts of Batavians are often
mentioned as constituting the auxiliaries of the 14th legion, which was
now in Britain. See Rit. in loc.</p>

<p id="id01229"><i>Ad mucrones</i>. The Britons were accustomed to fight with the edge of the
sword, and cut and hew the enemy. The Romans, on the contrary, made use
of the <i>point</i>. Of course in a close engagement, they would have greatly
the advantage. Br.—<i>Ad manus</i>. The opposite of <i>eminus</i>, i.e. <i>a close
engagement</i>. The same thing is expressed below by <i>complexum armorum</i>.</p>

<p id="id01230"><i>In aperto pugnam</i>. Literally a fight in the open field, i.e. a
<i>regular</i> pitched <i>battle</i>, which with its compact masses would be less
favorable to the large swords of the Britons, than a battle on ground
uncleared of thickets and forests. Al. <i>in arto</i>.</p>

<p id="id01231"><i>Miscere, ferire</i>, etc. A series of inf. denoting a rapid succession of
events, cf. note, 5: noscere—nosci; G. 30: praeponere.</p>

<p id="id01232"><i>Equitum turmae</i>, sc. Britannorum. The word <i>turmae</i> is applicable to
such a cavalry as theirs, cf. Ann. 14, 34: <i>Britannorum</i> copiae passim
per catervas et <i>turmas</i> exsultabant. Br. Ky. and others here understand
it of the Roman cavalry. But R. Dr. and Wr. apply it to the Britons, and
with reason, as we shall see below, and as we might infer indeed from its
close connexion with <i>covinarii</i>, for the <i>covinarii</i> were certainly
Britons.</p>

<p id="id01233"><i>Peditum proelio, hostium agminibus</i>. These also both refer to the
<i>Britons</i>. The covinarii were interspersed among their own infantry, and,
as the Romans advanced, became entangled with them. This is disputed. But
the small number of Romans slain in the whole battle is alone enough to
show, that <i>their</i> cavalry was not routed, nor <i>their</i> infantry broken in
upon by the chariots of the enemy. Moreover, how could T. properly use
the word <i>hostium</i> of his own countrymen?</p>

<p id="id01234"><i>Minimeque</i>, etc. This is one passage, among a few in T., which is so
manifestly corrupt that no sense can be made of it, as it stands in the
MSS. The reading given in the text is the simplest of all the conjectural
readings that have been proposed. It is that of Br. and E., and is
followed by the common editions. Cavalry took a large part in the battle.
But the battle wore little the aspect of an equestrian fight; for the
Britons, after maintaining their position with difficulty for some time,
were at length swept away by the bodies (the <i>mere uncontrolled bodies</i>)
of the horses—in short, the riders had no control over horses or
chariots, which rushed on without drivers obliquely athwart, or directly
through the lines, as their fears severally impelled them; all which was
in marked contrast to a Roman's idea of a regular battle of cavalry.</p>

<p id="id01235" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXVII. <i>Vacui. Free from apprehension</i>.</p>

<p id="id01236"><i>Ni</i>. Cf. note 4: ni.—<i>Subita belli. Unexpected emergencies</i> arising in
the course of the battle. Cf. 6: <i>inania honoris</i>.</p>

<p id="id01237"><i>Grande et atrox spectaculum</i>, etc. See a similar description in Sal.
Jug. 101. The series of infinitives and the omission of the connectives
(<i>asyndeton</i>) make the succession of events very rapid and animated.
Compare the famous <i>veni, vidi, vici</i>, of Caesar.</p>

<p id="id01238"><i>Prout—erat</i>. According to their different natural disposition, i.e.
<i>the timid, though armed, turned their backs before inferior numbers;
while the brave, though unarmed, met death in the face</i>.</p>

<p id="id01239"><i>Praestare terga</i> is an expression found only in T.</p>

<p id="id01240"><i>Et aliquando</i>, etc. <i>Et==ac tamen. And</i> yet (notwithstanding the flight
of crowds and the passive death of some as above) <i>sometimes to the
conquered also</i> there was <i>anger and bravery</i>. The language is Virgilian,
cf. Aen. 2, 367.</p>

<p id="id01241"><i>Quod</i>. Cf. note 12.—<i>Ni frequens—fiduciam foret</i>. "Had not A., who was
everywhere present, caused some strong and lightly equipped cohorts to
encompass the ground, while part of the cavalry having dismounted, made
their way through the thickets, and part on horseback scoured the open
woods, some disaster would have prcoeeded from this excess of
confidence." Ky.</p>

<p id="id01243"><i>Separare</i>, sc. consilia, i.e. <i>they sometimes act in concert, sometimes
provide only for their individual safety</i>.</p>

<p id="id01244"><i>Pignorum</i>. Cf. note G. 7: pignora—<i>Saevisse. Laid violent hands</i>. "This
picture of rage and despair, of tenderness, fury, and the tumult of
contending passions, has all the fine touches of a master who has studied
human nature." Mur.—<i>Secreti</i>==deserti.</p>

<p id="id01245"><i>Ubi. When</i>, cf. 26. Its direct influence extends to <i>nequibat</i>, and with
its clause, it expresses the <i>reason</i> why A. drew off his forces into the
country of the Horesti.—<i>Spargi bellum</i>==diversis locis, vel diviso
exercitu, vel vagando bellum geri. E.</p>

<p id="id01246"><i>Secunda—fama. Favored by the weather and the glory of their past
achievements</i> (lit. the weather and fame <i>following</i> them, <i>secunda

<p id="id01247"><i>Trutulensem portum</i>. Some port, now unknown, probably near the mouth of
the Tay or the Forth. <i>Unde</i> qualifies <i>lecto</i>. E. With <i>redierat</i> a
corresponding adv. denoting <i>whither</i>, is to be supplied: whence it had
set sail, and whither, after having surveyed all the nearest coast of
Britain, it had now returned. <i>Had</i> returned, i.e. prior to <i>entering</i>
the port; the action of <i>redierat</i>, was prior to that of <i>tenuit</i>. Hence
plup. <i>Proximo, nearest</i>, sc. to the scene of Agricola's operations,
i.e. the whole northern coast from the Forth to the Clyde and back again.
This was all that was necessary to prove Britain to be an island (cf.
chap. 10), the southern coast having been previously explored.</p>

<p id="id01248" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXIX. <i>Actum</i>. Al. auctum, a conjecture of Lipsius. <i>Actum==treated of,
reported.—Moris erat</i>. H. 402, I.; Z. 448, N. 1. N. 1.</p>

<p id="id01249"><i>Falsum—triumphum</i>. He had returned without so much as seeing the enemy
(Dio Cass. 67, 4); and yet he bought slaves, dressed them in German
style, had their hair stained red (G. 4: <i>rutilae comae</i>) and left long,
so as to resemble Germans, and then marched in triumph into Rome with his
train of pretended captives! Caligula had done the same before him. Suet.
Calig. 47.</p>

<p id="id01250"><i>Formarentur</i>. Subj. in a relative clause denoting a purpose (<i>quorum==ut
eorum</i>). H. 500; Z. 567.</p>

<p id="id01251"><i>Studia—acta</i>. Lawyers and politicians, all public men, had been gagged
and silenced by Domitian.</p>

<p id="id01252"><i>Alius</i>. Another than the Emperor.—<i>Occuparet==pre-occupy</i>, so as to rob
him of it.</p>

<p id="id01253"><i>Utcumque</i>. Somehow, possibly, perhaps. <i>Other things perhaps were more
easily concealed; but the merit of a good commander was an imperial
prerogative</i>.</p>

<p id="id01254"><i>Quodque—satiatus</i>. <i>And what was a proof of some cruel purpose, wholly
absorbed in his retirement</i> (where he never plotted any thing but
mischief, and where in early life he is said to have amused himself with
killing flies, Suet. Dom. 3). Cf. Plin. Panegyr. 48: nec unquam ex
solitudine sua prodeuntem, nisi ut solitudinem faceret. The whole passage
in Pliny is a graphic picture of the same tyrant, the workings of whose
heart are here so laid bare by the pen of Pliny's friend Tacitus.
<i>Secreto—satiatus</i> may also be translated: <i>satisfied with his own
secret</i>, i.e. keeping to himself his cherished hatred and jealousy.—
<i>Languesceret</i>. Subj. after <i>donec</i>. Cf. note, G. 37: <i>affectavere</i>.</p>

<p id="id01255"><i>Reponere odium</i>. See lexicon under <i>repono</i> for this phrase.</p>

popularity with the army should gradually decline</i>.</p>

<p id="id01257"><i>Etiam tum obtinebat</i>, i.e. he was still in <i>possession of the
government</i>, and of course in command of the army, in Britain.</p>

<p id="id01258" style="margin-top: 2em">XL. <i>Triumphalia ornamenta</i>. Not a real triumph, which from the reign of<br/>

Augustus was conceded only to the Emperor or the princes of the Imperial<br/>

Family; but triumphal insignia, such as the <i>corona, laurea, toga<br/>

praetexta, tunica palmata, sella curulis</i>, &amp;c. Dr.<br/>

thanksgivings were offered in the name of the victorious commander. Dr.</p>

<p id="id01261"><i>Addique</i>. Al. additque. <i>Addique</i> is the reading of the MSS. and old
editions. And it suits better the genius of Dom.; he did not express the
<i>opinionem</i> himself, for it was not his real intention, but he <i>ordered</i>
some one to put it in circulation as if from him, that he might have the
credit of it and yet not be bound by it.—<i>Destinari</i>, sc. by Domitian.</p>

<p id="id01262"><i>Majoribus reservatam</i>. <i>Majoribus</i>==illustrioribus. Syria was the
richest province in the Empire, and the praefectship of it the most
honorable office.</p>

<p id="id01263"><i>Ex secretioribus ministeriis</i>. <i>One of his private secretaries, or
confidential agents</i>.</p>

<p id="id01264"><i>Codicillos</i>. Under the Emperors this word is used to denote an imperial
letter or diploma. Properly a billet, diminutive of <i>codex</i>, tablet
(==<i>caudex</i>, trunk of a tree).</p>

<p id="id01265"><i>Syria dabatur</i>. Syria was one of the Provinces, that were at the
disposal of the Emperor.</p>

<p id="id01266"><i>Ex ingenio principis</i>. <i>In accordance with</i> (cf. <i>ex</i>, G. 7) <i>the</i>
(dissimulating) <i>genius or policy of Domitian</i>. The design, if not real,
at least imputed to him, was to withdraw Agricola from his province and
his troops at all events, by the offer of the best province in the Empire
if need be; but that object having been secured by Agricola's voluntary
retirement, the offer, and even the ordinary civilities of life,
especially official life, were deemed unnecessary. Compare this with the
concluding sentence of the preceding chapter.</p>

<p id="id01267"><i>Celebritate et frequentia</i>. Hendiadys: <i>By the number of distinguished
men who might go out to meet him</i> (and escort him into the city).</p>

<p id="id01268"><i>0fficio</i>==salutatione. Dr.—<i>Brevi osculo</i>, lit. a <i>hasty kiss</i>==<i>cold

the Romans, in the age of the Emperors. See Becker's Gallus, p. 54.</p>

<p id="id01269"><i>Turbae servientium</i>. The usual and characteristic associates, as well as

on <i>ambitio</i>, G. 27.</p>

<p id="id01274"><i>Quaererent—interpretarentur</i>. <i>Many inquired</i> (with wonder) <i>into the
reputation</i> (of a man so unassuming), <i>and few explained</i> or <i>understood</i>
(the true reason of his humble manner of life). <i>Interpretarentur</i>, not
<i>famam</i> but the facts above mentioned, and the necessity A. was under of
living as he did.—<i>Viso aspectoque. On seeing him and directing their

<p id="id01277"><i>Expugnati et capti</i>. <i>Defeated and taken captive</i>, For. and Fac.
Properly <i>expugnare</i> is said of a fortress or city. But <i>ektoliorkein</i> in
Greek is used in the same way, of persons. Compare <i>expugnatis
praesidiis</i>, 16, note. The wars particularly referred to are those
against Decebalus, leader of the Dacians, which lasted four years and in
which Moesia also was invaded by the Dacians, and several Roman armies
with their commanders were lost (Suet. Dom. 6.); and that of the
Pannonian legions against the German tribes of the Marcomanni and the
Quadi (Dion, 67, 7).</p>

<p id="id01278"><i>Hibernis—dubitatum</i>, i.e. the enemy not only met them on the river

quarters of their troops, and threatened to take away the territory they
had already acquired.</p>

<p id="id01291"><i>Beneficii invidia</i>, lit. <i>the odium of such a kindness==so odious a
favor</i>. The idea is, he did not blush to let A. return thanks for a
signal injury, as if it were a real kindness. "A refinement of cruelty
not unfrequently practised by the worst Roman Emperors." Ky. The only
peculiarity in the case of Dom. was, the unblushing impudence with which
he perpetrated the wrong, cf. 45. See a fine commentary on this passage
in Sen. de Benef. 4, 17: Quis est, qui non beneficus <i>videri</i> velit? qui
non inter scelera et injurias opinionem bonitatis affectet? velit quoque
<i>iis videri beneficium dedisse, quos laesit? gratias itaque agi sibi ab

for the purchase of salt. Cf. <i>clavarium</i>, H. 3, 50, note. But after
Augustus, official pay, <i>salary</i>.</p>
