  <body class="x-ebookmaker"><p id="id00449" style="margin-top: 2em">XXI. <i>Necesse est</i>. It is their duty and the law of custom. Gün.—
<i>Nec</i>==non tamen.—<i>Homicidium</i>. A post-Augustan word.</p>

<p id="id00450"><i>Armentorum ac pecorum</i>. For the distinction between these words, see
note, § 5. The high value which they attached to their herds and flocks,
as their <i>solae et gratissimae opes</i>, may help to explain the law or
usage here specified. Moreover, where the individual was so much more
prominent than the state, homicide even might be looked upon as a private
wrong, and hence to be atoned for by a pecuniary satisfaction, cf. Tur.
Hist. Ang. Sax., App. No. 3, chap. 1.</p>

<p id="id00451"><i>Juxta libertatem</i>, i.e. <i>simul cum libertate</i>, or inter liberos homines.
The form of expression is characteristic of the later Latin. Cf. Hand's
Tursellinus, vol. III. p. 538. Tacitus is particularly partial to this
preposition.</p>

<p id="id00452"><i>Convictibus</i>, refers to the entertainment of countrymen and friends,
<i>hospitiis</i> to that of strangers.</p>

<p id="id00453"><i>Pro fortuna. According to his means</i>. So Ann. 4, 23: fortunae inops.</p>

<p id="id00454"><i>Defecere</i>, sc. epulae. Quam exhausta sint, quae apparata erant, cf. 24:
omnia defecerunt.</p>

<p id="id00455"><i>Hospes</i>. Properly <i>stranger</i>; and hence either <i>guest</i> or <i>host</i>. Here
the latter.—<i>Comes. Guest</i>. So Gün. and the common editions. But most
recent editors place a colon after <i>comes</i>, thus making it <i>predicate</i>,
and referring it to the <i>host</i> becoming the guide and <i>companion</i> of his
guest to another place of entertainment.</p>

<p id="id00456"><i>Non invitati</i>, i.e. etiam si non invitati essent. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00457"><i>Nec interest</i>, i.e. whether invited or not.</p>

<p id="id00458"><i>Jus hospitis. The right of the guest</i> to a hospitable reception, So Cic.
Tus. Quaes., 1, 26: jus hominum.</p>

<p id="id00459"><i>Quantum ad</i> belongs to the silver age. In the golden age they said:
<i>quod attinet ad</i>, or simply <i>ad</i>. Gr. Cicero however has <i>quantum in</i>,
N. D. 3, 7; and Ovid, <i>quantum ad</i>, A. A. 1, 744. Cf. Freund sub voce.</p>

<p id="id00460"><i>Imputant. Make charge or account of</i>. Nearly confined to the later
Latin. Frequent in T. in the reckoning both of debt and credit, of praise
and blame. Cic. said: <i>assignare</i> alicui aliquid.</p>

<p id="id00461"><i>Obligantur</i>, i.e. obligatos esse putant. Forma passiva ad modum medii
verbi Graeci. Gün. Cf. note, 20: <i>miscentur</i>.</p>

<p id="id00462"><i>Victus—comis. The mode of life between host and guest is courteous</i>. For
<i>victus</i>==manner of life, cf. Cic. Inv. 1, 25, 35.</p>

<p id="id00463" style="margin-top: 2em">XXII. <i>E</i> is not exactly equivalent here to <i>a</i>, nor does it mean simply
<i>after</i>, but immediately on awaking <i>out of</i> sleep.—<i>Lavantur</i>, wash
themselves, i.e. bathe; like Gr. louomai. So aggregantur, 13;
<i>obligantur</i>, 21, et passim.</p>

<p id="id00464"><i>Calida</i>, sc. aqua, cf. in Greek, thermo louesthai, Aristoph. Nub. 1040.
In like manner Pliny uses <i>frigida</i>, Ep. 6, 16: semel iterumque
<i>frigidam</i> poposcit transitque. Other writers speak of the Germans as
bathing in their rivers, doubtless in the summer; but in the winter they
use the warm bath, as more agreeable in that cold climate. So in Russia
and other cold countries, cf. Mur. in loco.</p>

<p id="id00465"><i>Separatae—mensa</i>. Contra Romanorum luxuriam, ex more fere <i>Homerici</i>
aevi. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00466"><i>Sedes</i>, opposed to the triclinia, on which the Romans used to <i>recline</i>,
a practice as unknown to the rude Germans, as to the <i>early</i> Greeks and
Hebrews. See Coler. Stud. of Gr. Poets, p. 71 (Boston, 1842).</p>

<p id="id00467"><i>Negotia</i>. Plural==<i>their</i> various <i>pursuits</i>. So Cic. de Or. 2, 6:
<i>forensia negotia. Negotium==nec-otium</i>, C. and G. being originally
identical, as they still are almost <i>in form.—Armati</i>. Cf. note, 11: <i>ut
turbae placuit</i>.</p>

<p id="id00468"><i>Continuare</i>, etc. est diem noctemque jungere potando, sive die nocteque
perpotationem continuare. K.</p>

<p id="id00469"><i>Ut</i>, sc. solet fieri, cf. ut in licentia, § 2. The clause limits
<i>crebrae</i>; it is the <i>frequent occurrence</i> of brawls, that is customary
among those given to wine.</p>

<p id="id00470"><i>Transiguntur</i>. See note on transigitur, § 19.</p>

<p id="id00471"><i>Asciscendis</i>. i.e. assumendis.</p>

<p id="id00472"><i>Simplices</i> manifestly refers to the <i>expression</i> of thought; explained
afterwards by <i>fingere</i> nesciunt==<i>frank, ingenuous</i>. Cf. His. 1, 15:
<i>simplicissime loquimur</i>; Ann. 1, 69: <i>simplices curas</i>.</p>

<p id="id00473"><i>Astuta—callida. Astutus</i> est natura, <i>callidus</i> multarum rerum peritia.
Rit. <i>Astutus</i>, cunning; <i>callidus</i>, worldly wise. Död.</p>

<p id="id00474"><i>Adhuc. To this day</i>, despite the degeneracy and dishonesty of the age.
So Död. and Or. Rit. says: quae adhuc pectore clausa erant. Others still
make it==<i>etiam, even</i>. Cf. note, 19.</p>

<p id="id00475"><i>Retractatur</i>. Reviewed, <i>reconsidered</i>.</p>

<p id="id00476"><i>Salva—ratio est. The proper relation of both times is preserved</i>, or the
advantage of both is secured, as more fully explained in the next member,
viz. by <i>discussing when they are incapable of disguise, and deciding,
when they are not liable to mistake</i>. Cf. Or. in loc., and Bötticher,
sub v.</p>

<p id="id00477">Passow well remarks, that almost every German usage, mentioned in this
chapter, is in marked contrast with Roman manners and customs.</p>

<p id="id00478" style="margin-top: 2em">XXIII. <i>Potui</i>==pro potu, or in potum, dat. of the end. So 46: Victui
herba, vestitui pelles. T. and Sallust are particularly fond of this
construction. Cf. Böt. Lex. Tac., sub <i>Dativus</i>.</p>

<p id="id00479"><i>Hordeo aut frumento. Hordeo==barley; frumento</i>, properly fruit
(frugimentum, fruit [Greek: kat exochaen], i.e. grain), grain of any
kind, here <i>wheat</i>, cf. Veget. R.M. 1, 13: et milites pro frumento
hordeum cogerentur accipere.</p>

<p id="id00480"><i>Similitudinem vini. Beer</i>, for which the Greeks and Romans had no name.
Hence Herod. (2, 77) speaks of [Greek: oinos ek kritheon pepoiaemenos],
among the Egyptians.</p>

<p id="id00481"><i>Corruptus</i>. Cum Tacitea indignatione dictum, cf. 4: <i>infectos</i>, so Gün.
But the word is often used to denote mere change, without the idea of
being made worse, cf. Virg. Geor. 2, 466: Nec casia liquidi <i>corrumpitur</i>
usus olivi. Here render <i>fermented</i>.</p>

<p id="id00482"><i>Ripae</i>, sc. of the Rhine and Danube, i.e. the Roman border, as in 22:
proximi ripae.</p>

<p id="id00483"><i>Poma</i>. Fruits of any sort, cf. Pliny, N.H. 17, 26: arborem vidimus omni
genere <i>pomorum</i> onustum, alio ramo <i>nucibus</i>, alio <i>baccis</i>, aliunde
<i>vite, ficis, piris</i>, etc.</p>

<p id="id00484"><i>Recens fera. Venison</i>, or other game <i>fresh</i>, i.e. <i>recently taken</i>, in
distinction from the tainted, which better suited the luxurious taste of
the Romans.</p>

<p id="id00485"><i>Lac concretum</i>. Called <i>caseus</i> by Caes. B.G. 6, 22. But the Germans,
though they lived so much on milk, did not understand the art of making
cheese, see Pliny, N.H. 11, 96. "De caseo non cogitandum, potius quod
nostrates dicunt dickemilch" (i.e. <i>curdled milk</i>). Gün.</p>

<p id="id00486"><i>Apparatu. Luxurious preparation.—Blandimentis. Dainties</i>.</p>

<p id="id00487"><i>Haud minus facile</i>. Litotes for multo facilius.</p>

<p id="id00488"><i>Ebrietati</i>. Like the American Aborigines, see note, § 15.</p>

<p id="id00489" style="margin-top: 2em">XXIV. <i>Nudi</i>. See note, § 20.</p>

<p id="id00490"><i>Quibus id ludicrum. For whom it is a sport</i>; not whose business it is to
furnish the amusement: that would be <i>quorum est</i> K. and Gr.</p>

<p id="id00491"><i>Infestas</i>==porrectas contra saltantes. K.—<i>Decorem</i>. Poetic.</p>

<p id="id00492"><i>Quaestum</i>==quod quaeritur, <i>gain</i>.—<i>Mercedem</i>, stipulated pay, <i>wages</i>.</p>

<p id="id00493"><i>Quamvis</i> limits <i>audacis</i>==<i>daring as it is</i> (as you please).</p>

<p id="id00494"><i>Sobrii inter seria</i>. At Rome gaming was forbidden, except at the
Saturnalia, cf. Hor. Od. 3, 24, 68: vetita legibus alea. The remarkable
circumstance (<i>quod mirere</i>) in Germany was, that they practised it not
merely as an amusement at their feasts, but when sober among (<i>inter</i>)
their ordinary every-day pursuits.</p>

<p id="id00495"><i>Novissimo. The last</i> in a series. Very frequently in this sense in T.,
so also in Caes. Properly newest, then latest, <i>last</i>. Cf. note, His. 1,
47. <i>Extremo</i>, involving the greatest hazard, like our <i>extreme: last and
final</i> (decisive) <i>throw</i>. This excessive love of play, extending even to
the sacrifice of personal liberty, is seen also among the American
Indians, see Robertson, Hist. of America, vol. 2, pp. 202-3. It is
characteristic of barbarous and savage life, cf. Mur. in loco.</p>

<p id="id00496"><i>De libertate ac de corpore</i>. Hendiadys==<i>personal liberty</i>.</p>

<p id="id00497"><i>Voluntariam</i>. An earlier Latin author would have used <i>ipse, ultro</i>, or
the like, limiting the subject of the verb, instead of the object. The
Latin of the golden age prefers <i>concrete</i> words. The later Latin
approached nearer to the English, in using more <i>abstract</i> terms. Cf.
note on <i>repercussu</i>, 3.</p>

<p id="id00498"><i>Juvenior. More youthful</i>, and therefore more vigorous; not merely
younger (<i>junior</i>). See Död. and Rit. in loc. Forcellini and Freund cite
only two other examples of this full form of the comparative (Plin. Ep.
4, 8, and Apul. Met. 8, 21), in which it does not differ in meaning from
the common contracted form.</p>

<p id="id00499"><i>Ea</i>==talis or tanta. <i>Such</i> or <i>so great</i>. Gr.</p>

<p id="id00500"><i>Pervicacia. Pervicaces</i> sunt, qui in aliquo certamine <i>ad vincendum</i>
perseverant, Schol. Hor. Epod. 17, 14.</p>

<p id="id00501"><i>Pudore</i>. Shame, <i>disgrace</i>. So also His. 3, 61; contrary to usage of
earlier writers, who use it for sense of shame, <i>modesty</i>.</p>

<p id="id00502" style="margin-top: 2em">XXV. <i>Ceteris</i>. All but those who have gambled away their own liberty, as
in § 24.—<i>In nostrum morem</i>, &amp;c., with specific duties distributed
through the household (the slave-household, cf. note, 15), as explained
by the following clause. On the extreme subdivision of office among
slaves at <i>Rome</i>, see Beck. Gall. Exc. 2. Sc. 2; and Smith's Dic. Antiq.
under Servus.</p>

<p id="id00503"><i>Descripta</i>==dimensa, distributa. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00504"><i>Familiam</i>. Here the entire <i>body of servants</i>, cf. note, § 15.</p>

<p id="id00505"><i>Quisque</i>. Each <i>servant</i> has his own house and home.</p>

<p id="id00506"><i>Ut colono</i>. Like the <i>tenant</i> or <i>farmer</i> among the Romans; also the
vassal in the middle ages, and the serf in Modern Europe.</p>

<p id="id00507"><i>Hactenus. Thus far</i>, and <i>no farther</i>, i.e. if he pays his rent or tax,
no more is required of him.</p>

<p id="id00508"><i>Cetera</i>. The <i>rest of the duties</i> (usually performed by a <i>Roman
servant</i>), viz. those of the <i>house, the wife and children</i> (sc. of the
master) <i>perform</i>. Gr. strangely refers <i>uxor et liberi</i> to the wife and
children of the servant. Passow also refers <i>domus</i> to the house of the
servant, thus making it identical with the <i>penates</i> above, with which it
seems rather to be contrasted. With the use of <i>cetera</i> here, compare
His. 4, 56: <i>ceterum vulgus</i>==the rest, viz. the common soldiers, and see
the principle well illustrated in Döderlein's Essay, His. p. 17.</p>

<p id="id00509"><i>Opere. Hard labor</i>, which would serve as a punishment. The Romans
punished their indolent and refractory domestics, by sending them to
labor in the <i>country</i>, as well as by heavy chains (<i>vinculis</i>) and cruel
flagellations (<i>verberare</i>). They had also the power of life and death
(<i>occidere</i>). Beck. Gall. Exc. 2. Sc. 2; Smith's Dic. Ant. as above.</p>

<p id="id00510"><i>Non disciplina—ira</i>. Hendiadys==non disciplinae severitate, sed irae
impetu. Cf. His. 1, 51: <i>severitate disciplinae</i>.</p>

<p id="id00511"><i>Nisi—impune</i>, i.e. without the pecuniary penalty or satisfaction, which
was demanded when one put to death an enemy (<i>inimicum</i>). Cf. 21.</p>

<p id="id00512"><i>Liberti—libertini</i>. These words denote the same persons, but with this
difference in the idea: <i>libertus</i>==the freedman of some particular
master, <i>libertinus</i>==one in the <i>condition</i> of a freedman without
reference to any master. At the time of the Decemvirate, and for some
time after, liberti==emancipated slaves, libertini==the descendants of
such, cf. Suet. Claud. 24.</p>

<p id="id00513"><i>Quae regnantur. Governed by kings</i>. Ex poetarum more dictum, cf. Virg.
Aen. 6, 794: regnata per arva. So 43: Gothones regnantur, and 44:
Suiones. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00514"><i>Ingenuos</i>==free born; <i>nobiles</i>==high born.</p>

<p id="id00515"><i>Ascendunt</i>, i.e. ascendere possunt.</p>

<p id="id00516"><i>Ceteros</i>. By synesis (see Gr.) for ceteras, sc. gentes.</p>

<p id="id00517"><i>Impares</i>, sc. ingenuis et nobilibus.</p>

<p id="id00518"><i>Libertatis argumentum</i>, inasmuch as they value liberty and citizenship
too much to confer it on freedmen and slaves. This whole topic of
freedmen is an oblique censure of Roman custom in the age of the
Emperors, whose freedmen were not unfrequently their favorites and prime
ministers.</p>

<p id="id00519" style="margin-top: 2em">XXVI. <i>Fenus agitare. To loan money at interest</i>.</p>

<p id="id00520"><i>Et in usuras extendere. And to put out that interest again on interest</i>.
The other explanation, viz. that it means simply to put money at
interest, makes the last clause wholly superfluous.</p>

<p id="id00521"><i>Servatur. Is secured</i>, sc. abstinence from usury, or the non-existence
of usury, which is the essential idea of the preceding clause.</p>

<p id="id00522"><i>Ideo—vetitum esset</i>, sc. ignoti nulla cupido! Cf. 19: boni mores, vs.
bonae leges. Gün. The reader cannot fail to recognize here, as usual, the
reference to Rome, where usury was practised to an exorbitant extent. See
Fiske's Manual, § 270, 4. and Arnold's His. of Rome, vol. 1, passim.</p>

<p id="id00523"><i>Universis. Whole clans</i>, in distinction from individual owners.</p>

<p id="id00524"><i>In vices. By turns</i>. Al vices, vice, vicis. Död. prefers in vicis; Rit.
in vicos==for i.e. by villages. But whether we translate by turns or by
villages, it comes to the same thing. Cf. Caes. B.G. 6, 22.</p>

<p id="id00525"><i>Camporum, arva, ager, soli, terrae</i>, &amp;c. These words differ from each
other appropriately as follows: <i>Terra</i> is opposed to mare et coelum,
viz. <i>earth</i>. <i>Solum</i> is the substratum of any thing, viz. <i>solid ground
or soil</i>. <i>Campus</i> is an extensive plain or level surface, whether of
land or water, here <i>fields</i>. <i>Ager</i> is distinctively the territory that
surrounds a city, viz. <i>the public lands</i>. <i>Arvum</i> is ager <i>aratus</i>, viz.
<i>plough lands</i>. Bredow.</p>

<p id="id00526"><i>Superest</i>. There is enough, and more, cf. § 6, note.</p>

<p id="id00527"><i>Labore contendunt</i>. They do not strive emulously to equal the fertility
of the soil by their own industry. Passow.</p>

<p id="id00528"><i>Imperatur</i>. Just as frumentum, commeatus, obsides, etc., <i>imperantur,
are demanded or expected</i>. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00529"><i>Totidem</i>, sc. quot Romani, cf. idem, 4, note. Tacitus often omits one
member of a comparison, as he does also one of two comparative particles.</p>

<p id="id00530"><i>Species. Parts</i>. Sometimes the logical divisions of a genus; so used by
Cic. and Quin. (§ 6, 58): cum genus dividitur in species.</p>

<p id="id00531"><i>Intellectum</i>. A word of the silver age, cf. note on voluntariam, 24.
Intellectum—habent==<i>are understood and named</i>. "Quam distortum
dicendi genus!" Gün.</p>

<p id="id00532"><i>Autumni—ignorantur</i>. Accordingly in English, spring, summer and winter
are Saxon words, while autumn is of Latin origin (Auctumnus). See Dübner
in loc. Still such words as Härfest, Herpist, Harfst, Herbst, in other
Teutonic dialects, apply to the autumnal season, and not, like our word
harvest, merely to the fruits of it.</p>

<p id="id00533" style="margin-top: 2em">XXVII. <i>Funera</i>, proprie de toto apparatu sepulturae. E. Funeral rites
were performed with great pomp and extravagance at Rome; cf. Fiske's
Man., § 340; see also Mur. in loco, and Beck. Gall. Exc. Sc. 12.</p>

<p id="id00534"><i>Ambitio</i>. Primarily the solicitation of office by the candidate; then
the parade and display that attended it; then <i>parade</i> in general,
especially in a bad sense.</p>

<p id="id00535"><i>Certis</i>, i.e. rite statutis. Gün.</p>

<p id="id00536"><i>Cumulant</i>. Structura est poetica, cf. Virg. Aen. 11, 50: <i>cumulatque</i>
altaria donis. K.</p>

<p id="id00537"><i>Equus adjicitur</i>. Herodotus relates the same of the Scythians (4, 71);
Caesar, of the Gauls (B.G. 6, 19). Indeed all rude nations bury with the
dead those objects which are most dear to them when living, under the
notion that they will use and enjoy them in a future state. See
Robertson's Amer. B. 4, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id00538"><i>Sepulcrum—erigit</i>. Still poetical; literally: <i>a turf rears the comb</i>.
Cf. His. 5, 6: Libanum <i>erigit</i>.</p>

<p id="id00539"><i>Ponunt</i>==deponunt. So Cic. Tusc. Qu.: ad ponendum dolorem Cf. A. 20:
posuere iram.</p>

<p id="id00540"><i>Feminis—meminisse</i>. Cf. Sen. Ep.: Vir prudens meminisse perseveret,
lugere desinat.</p>

<p id="id00541"><i>Accepimus</i>. Ut ab aliis tradita audivimus, non ipsi cognovimus. K. See
Preliminary Remarks, p. 79.</p>

<p id="id00542"><i>In commune</i>. Cic. would have said, universe, or de universa origine. Gr.
Cic. uses <i>in commune</i>, but in a different sense, viz. for the common
weal. See Freund, sub voc.</p>

<p id="id00543"><i>Instituta</i>, political; <i>ritus</i>, religious.</p>

<p id="id00544"><i>Quae nationes. And what tribes</i>, etc.; <i>quae</i> for <i>quaeque</i> by
asyndeton, or perhaps, as Rit. suggests, by mistake of the copyist.—
<i>Commigraverint</i>. Subj. of the indirect question. Gr. 265, Z. 552.</p>

<p id="id00545">German critics have expended much labor and research, in defining the
locality of the several German tribes with which the remainder of the
Treatise is occupied. In so doing, they rely not only on historical data,
but also on the traces of ancient names still attached to cities,
forests, mountains, and other localities (cf. note, § 16). These we shall
sometimes advert to in the notes. But on the whole, these speculations of
German antiquarians are not only less interesting to scholars in other
countries, but are so unsatisfactory and contradictory among themselves,
that, for the most part, we shall pass them over with very little
attention. There is manifestly an intrinsic difficulty in defining the
ever changing limits of uncivilized and unsettled tribes. Hence the
irreconcilable contradictions between <i>ancient authorities</i>, as well as
modern critiques, on this subject. Tacitus, and the Roman writers
generally, betray their want of definite knowledge of Germany by the
frequency with which they specify the names of mountains and rivers. The
following geographical outline is from Ukert, and must suffice for the
<i>geography</i> of the remainder of the Treatise: "In the corner between the
Rhine and the Danube, are the Decumates Agri, perhaps as far as the
Mayne, 29. Northward on the Rhine dwell the Mattiaci, whose neighbors on
the east are the Chatti, 30. On the same river farther north are the
Usipii and the Tencteri; then the Frisii, 32-34. Eastward of the Tencteri
dwell the Chamavi and the Angrivarii (earlier the Bructeri), and east or
southeast of them the Dulgibini and Chasuarii, 34. and other small
tribes. Eastward of the Frisii Germany juts out far towards the north,
35. On the coast of the bay thus formed, dwell the Chauci, east of the
Frisii and the above mentioned tribes; on the south, they reach to the
Chatti. East of the Chauci and the Chatti are the Cherusci, 36. whose
neighbors are the Fosi. The Cherusci perhaps, according to Tacitus, do
not reach to the ocean; and in the angle of the above bay, he places the
Cimbri, 37. Thus Tacitus represents the western half of Germany. The
eastern is of greater dimensions. There are the Suevi, 38. He calls the
country Suevia, 41. and enumerates many tribes, which belong there.
Eastward of the Cherusci he places the Semnones and Langobardi; north of
them are the Reudigni, Aviones, Anglii, Varini, Eudoses, Suardones and
Nuithones; and all these he may have regarded as lying in the interior,
and as the most unknown tribes, 41. He then mentions the tribes that
dwell on the Danube, eastward from the Decumates Agri: the Hermunduri, in
whose country the Elbe has its source; the Narisci, Marcomanni and Quadi,
41-42. The Marcomanni hold the country which the Boii formerly possessed;
and northward of them and the Quadi, chiefly on the mountains which run
through Suevia, are the Marsigni, Gothini, Osi and Burii, 43. Farther
north are the Lygii, consisting of many tribes, among which the most
distinguished are the Arii, Helvecones, Manimi, Elysii and Naharvali, 43.
Still farther north dwell the Gothones, and, at the Ocean, the Rugii and
Lemovii. Upon islands in the ocean live the Suiones, 44. Upon the
mainland, on the coast, are the tribes of the Aestyi, and near them,
perhaps on islands, the Sitones, 45. Perhaps he assigned to them the
immense islands to which he refers in his first chapter. Here ends
Suevia. Whether the Peucini, Venedi and Fenni are to be reckoned as
Germans or Sarmatians, is uncertain, 46. The Hellusii and Oxonae are
fabulous."</p>

<p id="id00546">The following paragraph from Prichard's Researches embodies some of the
more general conclusions of <i>ethnographers</i>, especially of Zeuss, on whom
Prichard, in common with Orelli and many other scholars, places great
reliance. "Along the coast of the German Ocean and across the isthmus of
the Cimbric peninsula to the shore of the Baltic, were spread the tribes
of the Chauci and Frisii, the Anglii, Saxones and the Teutones or Jutes,
who spoke the <i>Low-German</i> languages, and formed one of the four
divisions of the German race, corresponding as it seems with the
<i>Ingaevones</i> of Tacitus and Pliny. In the higher and more central parts,
the second great division of the race, that of the <i>Hermiones</i>, was
spread, the tribes of which spoke <i>Upper</i> or <i>High-German</i> dialects.
Beginning in the West with the country of the Sigambri on the Rhine,
and from that of the Cherusci and Angrivarii near the Weser and the
Hartz, this division comprehended, besides those tribes, the Chatti, the
Langobardi, the Hermunduri, the Marcomanni and Quadi, the Lugii, and
beyond the Vistula the Bastarnae, in the neighborhood of the Carpathian
hills. To the eastward and northward of the last mentioned, near the
lower course of the Vistula and thence at least as far as the Pregel,
were the primitive abodes of the Goths and their cognate tribes, who are
perhaps the <i>Istaevones</i>." The fourth division of Prichard embraced the
Scandinavians, who spoke a language kindred to the Germans and were
usually classed with them. Those who would examine this subject more
thoroughly, will consult Adelung, Zeuss, Grimm, Ritter, Ukert, Prichard,
Latham, &amp;c., who have written expressly on the geography or the
ethnography of Germany.</p>

<p id="id00547" style="margin-top: 2em">XXVIII. <i>Summus auctorum</i>, i.e. omnium scriptorum is, qui plurimum
<i>auctoritatis fideique</i> habet. K. Cf. Sueton. Caes. 56. Though T.
commends so highly the <i>authority</i> of Caesar as a writer, yet he differs
from him in not a few matters of fact, as well as opinion; owing chiefly,
doubtless, to the increased means of information which he possessed in
the age of Trajan.</p>

<p id="id00548"><i>Divus Julius. Divus</i>==deified, <i>divine</i>; an epithet applied to the Roman
Emperors after their decease.—<i>Tradit</i>. Cf. Caes. B.G. 6, 24: fuit
antea tempus, cum <i>Germanos Galli</i> virtute <i>superarent</i>, ultro bella
inferrent, propter hominum multitudinem agrique inopiam trans Rhenum
colonias mitterent. Livy probably refers to the same events, when he says
(Lib. 5, 34), that in the reign of Priscus Tarquinius, two immense bodies
of Gauls migrated and took possession, the one of the Hercynian Forest,
the other of Upper Italy.</p>

<p id="id00549"><i>Amnis. The Rhine.—Promiscuas. Unsettled, ill defined</i>.</p>

<p id="id00550"><i>Quo minus</i> after a verb of hindering is followed by the subj. H. 499;
Z. 543.</p>

<p id="id00551"><i>Nulla—divisas</i>, i.e. <i>not distributed among different and powerful
kings</i>.</p>

<p id="id00552"><i>Hercyniam silvam</i>. A series of forests and mountains, stretching from
Helvetia to Hungary in a line parallel to the Danube, and described by
Caesar (B.G. 6, 25), as nine day's journey in breadth and more than
sixty in length. The name seems to be preserved in the modern <i>Hartz</i>
Forest, which is however far less extensive.</p>

<p id="id00553"><i>Igitur—Helvetii</i>==igitur <i>regionem</i>, inter, etc. See note on <i>colunt</i>,
16. <i>Igitur</i> seldom stands as the first word in a sentence in Cicero. Cf.
Z. 357; and Kühner's Cic. Tusc. Qu. 1, 6, 11. Here it introduces a more
particular explanation of the general subject mentioned at the close of
the previous chapter. So in A. 13. When so used, it sometimes stands
first in Cic., always in T. Cf. Freund sub v. Touching the Helvetii, see
Caes. B.G. 1, 1; T. His. 1, 67.</p>

<p id="id00554"><i>Boihemi nomen</i>. Compounded of Boii and heim (home of the Boii), now
Bohemia. <i>Heim==ham</i> in the termination of so many names of towns, e.g.
Framing_ham_, Notting_ham_. The Boii were driven from their country by
the Marcomanni, 42. The fugitives are supposed to have carried their name
into Boioaria, now Bavaria. Cf. Prichard's Physical Researches, Vol. III.
Chap. 1, Sec. 6; and Latham's Germany of Tacitus in loco.</p>

<p id="id00555"><i>Germanorum natione</i>, i.e. German in situation, not in origin, for this
he expressly denies or disproves in 43, from the fact that they spoke
the Pannonian language, and paid tribute. The doubt expressed here has
reference only to their original <i>location</i>, not to their original stock,
and is therefore in no way inconsistent with the affirmation in chapter
43.</p>

<p id="id00556"><i>Cum==since</i>. Hence followed by subj. H. 518, I.; Z. 577.</p>

<p id="id00557"><i>Utriusque ripae</i>. Here of the <i>Danube</i>, the right or Pannonian bank of
which was occupied by the Aravisci, and the left or German bank by the
Osi. So elsewhere of the <i>Rhine</i>, 37, and of both, 17, and 23.</p>

<p id="id00558"><i>Treveri</i>. Hence modern <i>Treves</i>.</p>

<p id="id00559"><i>Circa</i>. <i>In respect to</i>. A use foreign to the golden age of Latin
composition, but not unfrequent in the silver age. See Ann. 11, 2. 15.
His. 1, 43. Cf. Z. 298, and note, H. 1, 13.</p>

<p id="id00560"><i>Affectationem</i>. <i>Eager desire</i> to pass for native Germans. Ad verbum,
cf. note, II. 1, 80.</p>

<p id="id00561"><i>Ultro</i>. Radically the same with <i>ultra</i>==beyond. Properly beyond
expectation, beyond necessity, beyond measure, beyond any thing mentioned
in the foregoing context. Hence unexpectedly, freely, cheerfully, very
much, even more. Here <i>very</i>, <i>quite</i>. Gr.</p>

<p id="id00562"><i>Inertia Gallorum</i>. T., says Gün., is an everlasting persecutor of the
Gauls, cf. A. 11.</p>

<p id="id00563"><i>Haud dubie</i>==haud dubii. It limits Germanorum populi. <i>Undoubtedly
German tribes</i>.</p>

<p id="id00564"><i>Meruerint</i>. Not merely deserved, but <i>earned</i>, <i>attained</i>. For the subj.
after <i>quanquam</i>, cf. note, 35.</p>

<p id="id00565"><i>Agrippinenses</i>. From Agrippina, daughter of Germanicus and wife of
Claudius. Ann. 12, 27. Now Cologne.</p>

<p id="id00566"><i>Conditoris</i>. <i>Conditor</i> with the earlier Latins is an epicene, conditrix
being of later date. Here used of Agrippina. Of course <i>sui</i> cannot agree
with <i>conditoris</i>. It is a reflexive pronoun, the objective gen. after
<i>conditoris</i>==the founder of <i>themselves</i>, i.e. of their state, cf.
<i>odium sui</i>, 33.</p>

<p id="id00567"><i>Experimento</i>. Abl. <i>on</i> trial, not <i>for</i>; i.e. in consequence of being
found faithful. In reference to the Ubii, cf. His. 4, 28.</p>

<p id="id00568" style="margin-top: 2em">XXIX. <i>Virtute</i> sc. bellica.</p>

<p id="id00569"><i>Non multum ex ripa</i>. <i>A small tract on the bank, but chiefly an island
in the river</i>. Cf. His. 4, 12: extrema Gallicae orae, simulque insulam,
occupavere.</p>

<p id="id00570"><i>Chattorum quondam</i>. The very name Batavi is thought by some to be a
corrupted or modified form of Chatti. See Rit. in loc.</p>

<p id="id00571"><i>Transgressus. When</i> is not known, but Julius Caesar found them already
in possession of their new territory. B.G. 4, 10.</p>

<p id="id00573"><i>Nec—contemnuntur. Are neither dishonored</i>. So in His. 4, 17. the
Batavians are called <i>tributorum expertes</i>.</p>

<p id="id00574"><i>Oneribus. The burdens of regular taxation.—Collationibus. Extraordinary
contributions</i>.</p>

<p id="id00575"><i>Tela</i>, offensive; <i>arma</i>, defensive armor.</p>

<p id="id00576"><i>In sua ripa</i>. On the right or eastern bank of the Rhine. <i>Agunt</i> is to
be taken with <i>in sua ripa</i>, as well as with <i>nobiscum</i>, which are
antithetic to each other. Meaning: in situation Germans, in feeling
Romans.</p>

<p id="id00577"><i>Mente animoque. In mind and spirit. Mens</i> is properly the understanding,
<i>animus</i> the feeling part, and both together comprehend the whole soul.</p>

<p id="id00578"><i>Acrius animantur. Made more courageous by the influence of their very
soil and climate even</i> (<i>adhuc</i>, cf. note, 19).</p>

<p id="id00579"><i>Numeraverim</i>. Subj. cf. note, 2: <i>crediderim</i>.</p>

<p id="id00580"><i>Decumates—exercent. Exercent</i>==colunt, So Virg. tellurem, terram, humum,
solum, &amp;c., <i>exercere</i>.</p>

<p id="id00581"><i>Decumates</i>==decumanos. Occurs only here. Tithe-paying lands. For their
location, see note, 27.</p>

<p id="id00582"><i>Dubiae possessionis</i>, i.e. <i>insecure</i>, till confirmed by <i>limite acto
promotisque praesidiis</i>, i.e. <i>extending the boundary and advancing the
garrisons or outposts</i>.</p>

<p id="id00583"><i>Sinus. Extreme bend</i> or <i>border</i>. Cf. note, 1. So Virg. (Geor. 2 123)
calls India extremi <i>sinus</i> orbis.</p>

<p id="id00584"><i>Provinciae</i>. A province, not any particular one.</p>

<p id="id00585" style="margin-top: 2em">XXX. <i>Initium inchoant</i>. Pleonastic. So initio orto, His. 1, 76; initium
coeptum, His. 2, 79; perferre toleraverit, Ann. 3, 3. <i>Ultra</i> is farther

belongs to the later Latin, though Horace applies the word with <i>late</i> to
the sea: effusi late maria. Gr.</p>

<p id="id00587"><i>Durant siquidem</i>, etc. On the whole, I am constrained to yield to the
authority and the arguments of Wr., Or., Död., and Rit., and place the
pause before <i>durant</i>, instead of after it as in the first edition.
<i>Durant</i> precedes <i>siquidem</i> for the sake of emphasis, just as <i>quin
immo</i> (chap. 14) and <i>quin etiam</i> (13) yield their usual place to the
emphatic word. These are all departures from established usage. See notes
in loc. cit. <i>Que</i> must be understood, after <i>paulatim</i>: it is inserted
in the text by Ritter.</p>

<p id="id00588"><i>Rarescunt</i>. <i>Become fewer</i> and farther apart. So Virg. Aen. 3, 411:
<i>Angusti rarescent claustra Pelori</i>.</p>

<p id="id00589"><i>Chattos suos</i>. As if the Chatti were the children of the Forest, and the
Forest emphatically their country. Passow.</p>

<p id="id00590"><i>Prosequitur, deponit</i>. Begins, continues, and ends with the Chatti.
Poetical==is coextensive with.</p>

<p id="id00591"><i>Duriora</i>, sc. solito, or his, cf. Gr. 256, 9.—<i>Stricti, sinewy,

elliptically: <i>for Germans</i>.</p>

<p id="id00593"><i>Praeponere</i>, etc. A series of infinitives without connectives, denoting
a hasty enumeration of particulars; elsewhere, sometimes, a rapid
succession of events. Cf. notes, A. 36, and H. 1, 36. The particulars
here enumerated, all refer to <i>military</i> proceedings.</p>

<p id="id00594"><i>Disponere—noctem</i>. <i>They distribute the day</i>, sc. as the period of
various labors; <i>they fortify the night</i>, sc. as the scene of danger.
Still highly poetical.</p>

<p id="id00595"><i>Ratione</i>. <i>Way, manner</i>. Al. <i>Romanae</i>.</p>

<p id="id00596"><i>Ferramentis</i>. <i>Iron tools</i>, axes, mattocks, &amp;c.—<i>Copiis</i>. <i>Provisions</i>.</p>

<p id="id00597"><i>Rari</i>. Predicate of <i>pugna</i>, as well as <i>excursus</i>.—<i>Velocitas</i> applies
to cavalry, <i>cunctatio</i> to infantry; <i>juxta</i>==connected with, allied to,
cf. juxta libertatem, 21.</p>

<p id="id00598" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXI. <i>Aliis—populis</i>. Dat. after <i>usurpatum</i>, which with its adjuncts
is the subject of <i>vertit</i>. See same construction, His. 1, 18: observatum
id antiquitus comitiis dirimendis non terruit Galbam, etc., cf. also A.
1.—<i>Audentia</i> occurs only thrice in T. (G. 31. 34. Ann. 15, 53), and
once in Pliny (Ep. 8, 4). It differs from <i>audacia</i> in being a <i>virtue</i>.</p>

<p id="id00599"><i>Vertit</i>. Intrans. Not so found in Cic., but in Liv., Caes., and Sall.,
not unfrequent. Gr. Cic. however uses <i>anno vertente</i>.</p>

<p id="id00600"><i>In consensum vertit</i>. <i>Has become the common custom</i>.</p>

<p id="id00601"><i>Ut primum</i>. <i>Just as soon as</i>. A causal relation is also implied; hence
followed by the subj.</p>

<p id="id00602"><i>Crinem—submittere</i>. We find this custom (<i>of letting the hair and beard
grow long</i>) later among the Lombards and the Saxons, cf. Turn. His. Ang.
Sax., App. to B. 2.</p>

<p id="id00603"><i>Super—spolia</i>, i.e. <i>over the bloody spoils</i> of a slain enemy.</p>

<p id="id00604"><i>Revelant</i>, i.e. they remove the hair and beard, which have so long
<i>veiled</i> the face.</p>

<p id="id00605"><i>Retulisse==repaid, discharged their obligations to those who gave them
birth</i>.</p>

<p id="id00606"><i>Squalor</i>. This word primarily denotes roughness; secondarily and usually
filth: here the deformity of unshorn hair and beard.</p>

<p id="id00607"><i>Insuper</i>, i.e. besides the long hair and beard. The proper position of
<i>insuper</i> is, as here, between the adj. and subs., cf. 34: immensos
<i>insuper</i> lacus; see also <i>insuper</i>, 12.</p>

<p id="id00608"><i>Absolvat</i>. Subj. after <i>donec</i>. So <i>faciat</i> below. See note, 1.</p>

<p id="id00609"><i>Hic—habitus</i>, sc. <i>ferreum annulum</i>, cf. 17. <i>Plurimis</i>==permultis,
Rit.</p>

<p id="id00610"><i>Placet</i>. Antithetic to <i>ignominiosum genti</i>. Very many of the Chatti are
<i>pleased</i> with that which is esteemed a disgrace by most Germans, and so
pleased with it as to retain it to old age, and wear it as a badge of
distinction (<i>canent insignes</i>).</p>

<p id="id00611"><i>Nova</i>. Al. <i>torva. Strange, unusual</i>. Placed in the <i>van</i> (<i>prima
acies</i>), because as the author says, § 43: primi in omnibus proeliis
<i>oculi</i> vincuntur.</p>

<p id="id00612"><i>Mansuescunt</i>. Primarily said of wild beasts, <i>accustomed to the hand of
man</i> or <i>tamed</i>. So <i>immanis</i>, <i>not</i> handled, wild, savage. The clause
introduced by <i>nam</i> illustrates or enforces <i>visu nova</i>, and may be
rendered thus: <i>for not even in time of peace do they grow gentle</i> and
put on <i>a milder aspect</i>.</p>

<p id="id00613"><i>Exsanguis</i>. Usually lifeless or pale. Here <i>languid, feeble</i>.</p>

<p id="id00614" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXII. <i>Alveo</i>==quoad alveum. Abl. of respect, H. 429; Z. 429.</p>

<p id="id00615"><i>Certum. Fixed, well defined</i>, i.e. not divided and diffused, (so as to
form of itself no sufficient border or boundary to the Roman Empire) as
it was nearer its source among the Chatti. So this disputed word seems to
be explained by the author himself in the following clause; <i>quique
terminus esse sufficiat==and such that it suffices to be a boundary</i>.
<i>Qui==talis ut</i>; hence followed by the subj. H. 500, I.; Z. 558. So Mela
(3, 2) contrasts <i>solidus et certo alveo lapsus</i> with <i>huc et illuc
dispergitur</i>.</p>

<p id="id00616"><i>Tencteris</i>==apud Tencteros, by <i>enallage</i>, cf. note on <i>ad patrem</i>, 20,
and other references there. The Tencteri and Usipii seem to have been at
length absorbed into the mass of people, who appear under the later name
of Alemanni. Cf. Prichard.</p>

<p id="id00617"><i>Familiam. Servants</i>, cf. note on same word, 15. See also Beck Gall.,
Exc. 1. Sc. 1.—Penates==our <i>homestead</i>.</p>

<p id="id00618"><i>Jura succesionum==heir looms</i>, all that goes down by hereditary
descent.</p>

<p id="id00619"><i>Excipit</i>. Here in the unusual sense of <i>inherits.—Cetera</i>, sc. <i>jura
successionum</i>.</p>

<p id="id00620"><i>Bello</i>. Abl. and limits both <i>ferox</i> and <i>melior</i>. Meaning: <i>The horses
are inherited, not, like the rest of the estate, by the eldest son, but
by the bravest</i>.</p>

<p id="id00621" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXIII. <i>Occurrebant. Met the view, presented themselves</i>. Almost the
sense of the corresponding English word. The structure of <i>narratur</i>
(as impers.) is very rare in the earlier authors, who would say:
<i>Chamavi narrantur</i>. Cf. His. 1, 50. 90. The <i>Chamavi</i>, &amp;c., were
joined afterwards to the Franks. Cf. Prichard. The present town of
<i>Ham</i> in Westphalia probably preserves the name and gives the
<i>original</i> locality of the <i>Chamavi</i>, the present <i>Engern</i> that of the
<i>Angrivarii</i>. The termination varii or uarii probably==inhabitants of.
Thus angrivarii==inhabitants of Engern. Chasuarii==Inhabitants of the
river Hase. The same element is perhaps contained in the termination of
Bruct_eri_ and Tenct_eri_. See Latham in loco.</p>

<p id="id00622"><i>Nos, se</i>. Romanos. <i>Erga</i>==inclined to (cf. vergo), <i>towards</i>.</p>

<p id="id00623"><i>Spectaculo</i>. Ablative. Invidere is constructed by the Latins in the
following ways: invidere alicui aliquid, alicui alicujus rei, alicui
aliqua re, alicui in aliqua re. Hess. The construction here (with the
abl. of the thing, which was the object of envy) belongs to the silver
age. Cf. Quint. (Inst. 9, 3, 1) who contrasts it with the usage of
Cicero, and considers it as illustrating the fondness of the age for
<i>figurative</i> language.</p>

<p id="id00624"><i>Oblectationi oculisque</i>. Hendiadys for ad oblectationem oculorum. The
author here exults in the promiscuous slaughter of the German Tribes by
each other's arms, as a brilliant spectacle to Roman eyes—a feeling
little congenial to the spirit of Christianity, but necessarily nurtured
by the gladiatorial shows and bloody amusements of the Romans, to say
nothing of the habitual hostility which they waged against all other
nations, that did not submit to their dominion.</p>

<p id="id00625"><i>Quaeso</i>, sc. <i>deos</i>. Though <i>fortune</i> is spoken of below, as controlling
the destiny of nations. This passage shows clearly that Tacitus, with all
his partiality for German manners and morals, still retains the heart of
a Roman patriot. He loves his country with all her faults, and bears no
good-will to her enemies, however many and great their virtues. The
passage is important, as illustrating the spirit and design of the whole
Treatise. The work was not written as a blind panegyric on the Germans,
or a spleeny satire on the Romans. Neither was it composed for the
purpose of stirring up Trajan to war against Germany; to such a purpose,
such a clause, as <i>urgentibus imperii fatis</i>, were quite adverse. Least
of all was it written for the mere pastime and amusement of Roman
readers. It breathes the spirit at once of the earnest patriot, and the
high-toned moralist.</p>

<p id="id00626"><i>Odium sui</i>. Cf. note, 28: <i>conditor. Hatred of themselves</i>; i.e. of one
another. So in Greek, the reflexive pronoun is often used for the
reciprocal.</p>

<p id="id00627"><i>Quando==since</i>; a subjective reason. Cf. note, His. I, 31; and Z. 346.
—<i>Urgentibus—fatis</i>, sc. to discord and dissolution, for such were the
forebodings of patriotic and sagacious minds ever after the overthrow of
the Republic, even under the prosperous reign of Trajan.</p>

<p id="id00628" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXIV. <i>A tergo</i>, i.e. further back from the Rhine, or towards the East—
<i>A fronte</i>, nearer the Rhine or towards the West. Both are to be referred
to the Angrivarii and Chamavi, who had the Dulgibini and the Chasuarii in
their rear (on the east), and the Frisii on their front (towards the west
or northwest).—<i>Frisii</i>, the Frieslanders.</p>

<p id="id00629"><i>Majoribus—virium. They have the name of Greater or Less Frisii,
according to the measure of their strength</i>. For this sense of <i>ex</i>
see note 7. For the case of <i>majoribus minoribusque</i> see Z. 421, and
H. 387, 1.</p>

<p id="id00630"><i>Praetexuntur. Are bordered by the Rhine</i> (hemmed, as the toga
<i>praetexta</i> by the purple); or, as Freund explains, are covered by it,
i.e. lie behind it—<i>Immensos lacus</i>. The bays, or arms of the sea, at
the mouth of the Rhine (Zuyder Zee, etc.), taken for lakes by T. and
Pliny (Ann. 1, 60. 2, 8. N.H. 4, 29). They have been greatly changed by
inundations. See Mur. in loco.</p>

<p id="id00631"><i>Oceanum</i>, sc. Septentrionalem.—<i>Sua</i>, sc. parte.—<i>Tentavimus,
explored</i>.</p>

<p id="id00632"><i>Herculis columnas</i>. "Wherever the land terminated, and it appeared
impossible to proceed further, ancient maritime nations feigned pillars
of Hercules. Those mentioned in this passage some authors have placed at
the extremity of Friesland, and others at the entrance of the Baltic."
Ky. cf. note, 3.</p>

<p id="id00633"><i>Adiit</i>, i.e. vere adiit, <i>actually</i> visited that part of the world.</p>

<p id="id00634"><i>Quicquid—consensimus</i>. This passage is a standard illustration of the
<i>Romana interpretatione</i> (§ 43), the Roman construction, which the Romans
put upon the mythology and theology of other nations. It shows that they
were accustomed to apply the names of their gods to the gods of other
nations on the ground of some resemblance in character, history, worship,
&amp;c. Sometimes perhaps a resemblance in the <i>names</i> constituted the ground
of identification.</p>

<p id="id00635"><i>Druso Germanico</i>. Some read Druso <i>et</i> Germanico; others Druso,
Germanico, as a case of asyndeton (Gr. 323, 1 (1.)); for both Drusus and
Germanicus sailed into the Northern Ocean, and it is not known that
Germanicus (the son of Drusus and stepson of Tiberius, who is by some
supposed to be meant here) is ever called <i>Drusus Germanicus</i>. But
Drusus, the father of Germanicus, is called Drusus Germanicus in the
Histories (5, 19), where he is spoken of as having thrown a mole or dam
across the Rhine; and it is not improbable that he is the person here
intended. So K., Or. and Wr.</p>

<p id="id00636"><i>Se</i>, i.e. the Ocean. See H. 449, II.; Z. 604.</p>

<p id="id00637"><i>Inquiri</i>. Impersonal==<i>investigation to be made. E</i>. suggests
<i>inquirenti</i>, agreeing with <i>Germanico</i>. But T., unlike the earlier Latin
authors, not unfrequently places an infin. after a verb of hindering.</p>

<p id="id00638"><i>Credere quam scire</i>. T. perhaps alluded to the precept of the
Philosopher, who said: Deum cole, atque crede, sed noli quaerere.
Murphy.</p>

<p id="id00639" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXV. <i>In Septentrionem</i>, etc. <i>On the North, it falls back</i>, sc. into
the Ocean, <i>with</i> an immense <i>bend</i> or peninsula. The <i>flexus</i> here
spoken of is called <i>sinus</i> in chap. 37, and describes the Cimbric
Chersonesus, or Danish Peninsula. See Död., Or. and Rit. in loc.—<i>Ac
primo statim. And first immediately</i>, sc. as we begin to trace the
northern coast.—<i>Lateribus</i>, sc. the eastern.</p>

<p id="id00640"><i>Quanquam</i> followed by the subj., seldom in Cic., but usually in T.,
Z. 574, Note. Cf. note, His. 5, 21.—<i>Sinuetur</i>, sc. southwards.
<i>Donec—sinuetur</i>. Cf. note, 1: <i>erumpat</i>.</p>

<p id="id00641"><i>Inter Germanos</i>. Considered among the Germans, <i>in the estimation of the
Germans</i>.</p>

<p id="id00642"><i>Quique—tueri</i>. A clause connected to an <i>adj</i>. (nobilissimus), cf.
certum, quique, 32. <i>Qui</i> in both passages==talis, ut. Hence followed by
subj. H. 501, I.; Z. 558.</p>

<p id="id00643"><i>Impotentia, ungoverned passion, [Greek: akrateia]. Impotentia</i> seldom
denotes want of power, but usually that unrestrained passion, which
results from the want of ability to control one's self.</p>

<p id="id00644"><i>Ut—agant</i> depends on <i>assequuntur</i>. Subj. H. 490; Z. 531, <i>a</i>.</p>

<p id="id00645"><i>Si res poscat</i>. Some copies read: si res poscat <i>exercitus</i>. But posco
and postulo seldom have the object expressed in such clauses, cf. 44: ut
res poscit; 6: prout ratio poscit. So also Cic. and Sall., pass.
<i>Exercitus</i> is subject nom., <i>promptus</i> being understood, as pred.; and
<i>plurimum virorum equorumque</i> explains or rather enforces <i>exercitus:
and, if the case demand, an army, the greatest abundance of men and
horses</i>.</p>

<p id="id00646"><i>Quiescentibus</i>, i.e. bellum non gerentibus; <i>eadem</i>, i.e. the same, as
if engaged in war.</p>

<p id="id00647" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXVI. <i>Cherusci</i>. It was their chief, Arminius (Germ. Hermann), who,
making head against the Romans, was honored as the Deliverer of Germany,
and celebrated in ballad songs, which are preserved to this day. See his
achievements in Ann. B. 1, and 2. This tribe became afterwards the head
of the Saxon confederacy.</p>

<p id="id00648"><i>Marcentem. Enervating</i>. So <i>marcentia pocula</i>, Stat. Silv. 4, 6, 56. It
is usually intransitive, and is taken here by some in the sense of
languid, enervate (literally withered).—<i>Illacessiti</i> is a post-Augustan
word. Cf. Freund.</p>

<p id="id00649"><i>Impotentes</i>. Cf. impotentia, 35.</p>

<p id="id00650"><i>Falso quiescas</i>. Falleris, dum quiescis. Dilthey. Cf. note, 14:
<i>possis</i>.</p>

<p id="id00651"><i>Ubi manu agitur</i>. Where matters are decided by might rather than right.
Cf. <i>manu agens</i>, A. 9.</p>

<p id="id00652"><i>Nomina superioris. Virtues</i> (only) <i>of the stronger party</i>, the
conqueror. They are deemed vices in the weaker.</p>

<p id="id00653"><i>Chattis—cessit: while to the Chatti</i>, who were <i>victorious, success
was imputed for wisdom</i>. The antithetic particle at the beginning of the
clause is omitted. Cf. note, 4: <i>minime</i>.</p>

<p id="id00654"><i>Fuissent</i>. Subj. after <i>cum</i> signifying <i>although</i>. H. 516, II.</p>

<p id="id00655" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXVII. <i>Sinum. Peninsula</i>, sc. the Cimbric. Cf. note, 35: <i>flexu</i>; 81:
<i>sinus</i>.</p>

<p id="id00656"><i>Cimbri</i>. The same with the Cimmerii, a once powerful race, who,
migrating from western Asia, that hive of nations, overran a large part
of Europe, but their power being broken by the Romans, and themselves
being overrun and conquered by the Gothic or German Tribes, they were
pushed to the extreme western points of the continent and the British
Isles, where, and where alone, distinct traces of their language and
literature remain to this day. They have left their name indelibly
impressed on different localities in their route, e.g. the Cimmerian
Bosphorus, the Cimbric Chersonesus (now Jutland, occupied by the Cimbri
in the days of T.), Cumberland (Cumbria, from Cimbri) &amp;c. The ancient
name of the Welsh was also Cymri, cf. Tur. His. Ang. Sax. 1. 2.</p>

<p id="id00657"><i>Gloria</i> is abl. limiting <i>ingens</i>.</p>

<p id="id00658"><i>Castra ac spatia</i>. In apposition with <i>lata vestigia</i>==spatiosa castra
or castrorum spatia, H. 704, II. 2; Z. 741.</p>

<p id="id00659"><i>Utraque ripa</i>, sc. of the Rhine, <i>the</i> river and river bank by eminence.</p>

<p id="id00660"><i>Molem manusque. The mass of their population, and the number of their
armies</i>. Observe the alliteration, as if he had said: measure the mass
and might.</p>

<p id="id00661"><i>Exitus</i>, i.e. <i>migrationis</i>. Often used in this sense, cf. Caes. B.C.
3, 69: Salutem et <i>exitum</i> sibi pariebant.—<i>Fidem, proof</i>.</p>

<p id="id00662"><i>Sexcentesimum—annum</i>. T. follows the Catonian Era. According to
the Varronian Era, received by the moderns, the date would be A.U.C.
641 = A.C. 113.</p>

<p id="id00663"><i>Alterum—consulatum</i>. The second consulship of Trajan (when he was also
Emperor) was, after the reckoning of Tacitus, A.U.C. 850, according to
modern computation, 851 = A.D. 98. This year doubtless marks the time when
this treatise was written, else why selected?</p>

<p id="id00664"><i>Vincitur</i>. So long is Germany in being conquered. (The work was never
completed.) Cf. Liv. 9, 3: quem per annos jam prope <i>triginta vincimus</i>.</p>

<p id="id00665"><i>Medio—spatio. In the intervening period</i>, sc. of 210 years.</p>

<p id="id00666"><i>Samnis—Galliaeve</i>. The Romans had fought bloody, and some times
disastrous battles with the Samnites (at the Caudine Forks, Liv. 9, 2.),
with the Carthaginians (in the several Punic Wars), with the Spaniards
under Viriathus and Sertorius (Florus, Lib. 2.), with the Gauls (Caes.
B.G. pass.). But none of these were so sanguinary as their wars with the
Germans.</p>

<p id="id00667"><i>Admonuere</i>, sc. vulneribus, cladibus==castigavere.</p>

<p id="id00668"><i>Regno—libertas</i>. Liberty and monarchy in studied antithesis. T. means to
imply that the former is the stronger principle of the two.</p>

<p id="id00669"><i>Arsacis</i>. The family name of the Parthian kings, as Pharaoh and Ptolemy
of the Egyptian, Antiochus of the Syrian, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id00670"><i>Amisso et ipse</i>, sc. <i>oriens</i>; the East <i>itself also lost</i> its prince
(Pacorus), in the engagement, as well as the Romans their leader
(Crassus).—<i>Objecerit, reproach us with</i>. Subj. Cf. n. G. 2: <i>peteret</i>.</p>

<p id="id00671"><i>Ventidium</i>. Commander under Anthony, and conqueror of the Parthians in
three battles, A.U.C. 715. He was raised from the lowest rank and the
meanest employment, hence perhaps the expression, <i>dejectus infra,
humbled beneath Ventidius</i>.</p>

<p id="id00672"><i>Carbone—Manlio</i>, Cneius Papirius Carbo defeated at Noreja, A.U. 641
(Liv. Epit. 63.), L. Cassius Longinus defeated and slain, 647 (Caes. B.G.
1, 7. 12.), M. Aurelius Scaurus defeated and taken captive, 648 (Liv.
Epit. 67.), Servilius Caepio and M. Manlius defeated with great slaughter
at Tolosa, 649 (Liv. Epit. 67.), Quintilius Varus defeated and slain, 762
(Suet. Oct. 23.)—all these victories over the Romans in their highest
strength and glory—either in the time of the <i>Republic (Populo Romano)</i>,
or of the <i>Empire</i> under Augustus (<i>Caesari</i>)—all these attested the
courage and military prowess of the Germans; and they were still, for the
most part, as free and as powerful as ever.</p>

<p id="id00673"><i>Caius Marius</i> almost annihilated the Cimbri at Aquae Sextiae, A.U.C.
652.</p>

<p id="id00674"><i>Drusus</i>. Claudius Drusus invaded Germany four times, 742-3, and finally
lost his life by falling from his horse on his return, cf. Dio. Libb. 54.
55.</p>

<p id="id00675"><i>Nero</i>, commonly known as Tiberius (brother of Drusus and stepson of
Augustus), had the command in Germany at three different times, 746-7,
756-9, 764-5, cf. Suet. Tib. 9. seq.</p>

<p id="id00676"><i>Germanicus</i>, son of Drusus, made four campaigns in Germany, A.D. 14-16,
cf. Ann. B. 1. and 2.</p>

<p id="id00677"><i>C. Caesaris</i>. Caligula, cf. Suet. Calig.; T. His. 4, 15.</p>

<p id="id00678"><i>Discordiae—armorum</i>. The civil wars after the death of Nero under
Galba, Otho, and Vitellius.</p>

<p id="id00679"><i>Expugnatis—hibernis</i>. By the Batavians under Civilis. His. 4, 12 seq.;
A. 41.</p>

<p id="id00680"><i>Affectavere. Aspired to the government of</i>, cf. note on affectationem,
28. After <i>donec</i>, T. always expresses a single definite past action by
the perf. ind., cf. A. 36: <i>donec—cohortatus est</i>; a repeated, or
continued past action by the imp. subj. cf. note, A. 19: <i>donec—fieret</i>;
and a present action, which is in the nature of the case also a continued
action, by the pres. subj. cf. note, 1: <i>separet</i>.</p>

<p id="id00681"><i>Triumphati</i>. Poetice, cf. Virg. Aen. 6, 837: Triumphata Corintho; Hor.
Od. 3, 3, 43: Triumphati Medi. The reference here is to the ridiculous
triumph of Domitian, A. 39, in which slaves, purchased and dressed out
for the purpose, were borne as captives through the streets.</p>

<p id="id00682" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXVIII. <i>Suevis</i>. In the time of T. a powerful confederacy, embracing
all the tribes enumerated in 39-45, and covering all the eastern and
larger half of Germany. But the confederacy was soon dissolved and seldom
appears in subsequent history. We still have a trace of their name in the
Modern <i>Suabia</i>. The name is supposed by some philologists (e.g. Zeuss)
to denote <i>unsettled wanderers</i> (Germ. Schweben, to wave, to hover, cf.
Caes. B.G. 4, 1: Suevis non longius anno remanere uno in loco, etc.); as
that of the Saxons does settlers, or <i>fixed residents</i> (Germ. Sassen),
and that of the Franks, <i>freemen</i>. See Rup. in loc. An ingenious Article
in the North American Review (July, 1847), makes the distinction of Suevi
and non-Suevi radical and permanent in the religion and the language of
the Germans; the Suevi becoming Orthodox Catholics, and the non-Suevi
Arians in Ecclesiastical History, and the one High-Dutch and the other
Low-Dutch in the development of their language.</p>

<p id="id00683"><i>Adhuc</i>. Cf. note on it, 19. As to position, cf. <i>insuper</i> 31, and 34.
The Suevi are <i>still (adhuc)</i> divided into distinct tribes bearing
distinct names, though united in a confederacy. Cf. Hand's Tursellinus,
1, 163. Död. renders <i>besides</i>, sc. the general designation of Suevi.</p>

<p id="id00684"><i>In commune. In common</i>. Not used in this sense by Cic., Caes. and Liv.,
though frequent in T. Gr. Cf. note on the same, 27.</p>

<p id="id00685"><i>Obliquare. To turn the hair back, or comb it up</i> contrary to its natural
direction—and then fasten it in a knot on the top of the head
(<i>substringere nodo</i>); so it seems to be explained by the author himself
below: <i>horrentem capillum retro sequuntur ac in ipso solo vertice
religant</i>. Others translate <i>obliquare</i> by <i>twist</i>. Many ancient writers
speak of this manner of tying the hair among the Germans, cf. Sen. de
Ira. 3, 26.; Juv. 13, 164.</p>

<p id="id00686"><i>A servis separantur. Separantur</i>==distinguuntur. Servants among the
Suevi seem to have had their hair shorn. So also it was among the Franks
at a later date. Vid. Greg. Tur. 3, 8.</p>

<p id="id00687"><i>Rarum et intra</i>, etc. Enallage, cf. note <i>certum quique</i>, 32.</p>

<p id="id00688"><i>Retro sequuntur</i>, i.e. <i>follow it back</i>, as it were, in its growth, and
<i>tie it up on the very crown of the head only</i>, instead of letting it
hang down, as it grows (submittere crinem). So K., Or. and many others.
Passow and Död. take sequuntur in the sense of <i>desire, delight in</i> (our
word <i>seek</i>). The word bears that sense, e.g. 5: argentum magis quam
aurum <i>sequuntur</i>. But then what is <i>retro</i> sequuntur? for <i>retro</i> must
be an adjunct of <i>sequuntur</i> both from position, and because there is no
other word which it can limit. <i>Saepe</i> implies, that sometimes they made
a knot elsewhere, but <i>often they fasten</i> it there, and there <i>only</i>. See
Or. in loc. This whole passage illustrates our author's disposition to
avoid technical language. Cf. note, II. 2, 21.</p>

<p id="id00689"><i>Innoxiae. Harmless</i>, unlike the beauty cultivated among the <i>Romans</i> to
dazzle and seduce.</p>

<p id="id00690"><i>In altitudinem</i>, etc. <i>For the sake of</i> (increased) <i>height and terror</i>,
i.e. to appear tall and inspire terror. Cf. note, A, 5: <i>in
jactationem</i>; A. 7: <i>in suam famam</i>. The antithetic particle is omitted
before this clause as it often is by our author.</p>

<p id="id00691"><i>Ut hostium oculis</i>, to strike with terror the eyes of the enemy, for
primi in omnibus proeliis <i>oculi</i> vincuntur, 43.</p>

<p id="id00692" style="margin-top: 2em">XXXIX. <i>Vetustissimos. Oldest</i>. <i>Vetus</i> is <i>old</i>, of long <i>duration</i>
([Greek; etos], aetas). <i>antiquus, ancient</i>, belonging to a <i>preceding</i>
age (ante). <i>Recens</i> (fresh, young) is opposed to the former: <i>novus</i>
(new, modern), to the latter. See Ramshorn and Freund.</p>

<p id="id00693"><i>Fides antiquitatis. Antiquitatis</i> is objective gen.==<i>the belief, or
persuasion of their antiquity</i>.</p>

<p id="id00694"><i>Auguriis—sacram</i>. The commentators all note the hexameter structure of
these words, and many regard them as a quotation from some Latin poet.
The words themselves are also poetical, e.g. <i>patrum</i> for <i>majorum</i>, and
<i>formidine</i> for <i>religione</i>. The coloring is Virgilian. Cf. Aen. 7, 172;
8, 598. See Or. in loc. and Preliminary Remarks to the Histories, p. 234.</p>

<p id="id00695"><i>Legationibus coeunt</i>. Just as we say: <i>convene by their delegates</i>, or
<i>representatives</i>.</p>

<p id="id00696"><i>Publice</i>==publica auctoritate, cf. same word, 10.</p>

<p id="id00697"><i>Primordia</i>. Initiatory rites.</p>

<p id="id00698"><i>Minor</i>, sc. numine. <i>Inferior to the god</i>.</p>

<p id="id00699"><i>Prae se ferens. Expressing in his external appearance, or bearing in his
own person an acknowledgment of the power of the divinity</i>.</p>

<p id="id00700"><i>Evolvuntur</i>==se evolvunt, cf. Ann. 1, 13: cum Tiberii genua
advolveretur; also <i>lavantur</i>, 22.</p>

<p id="id00701"><i>Eo—tanquam. Has reference to this point, as if</i>, i.e. to this opinion,
viz. that thence, etc. Cf. <i>illuc respicit tanquam</i>, 12.—<i>Inde</i> From the
grove, or the god of the grove. Cf. 3: <i>Tuisconem … originem gentis</i>.</p>

<p id="id00702"><i>Adjicit auctoritatem</i>, sc. isti superstitioni.</p>

<p id="id00703"><i>Magno corpore</i>==reipublicae magnitudine. <i>Corpore</i>, the body politic. So
His. 4, 64: redisse vos in corpus nomenque Germanorum.—<i>Habitantur</i>. Al.
habitant and habitantium, by conjecture. The subject is the Semnonian
<i>country</i> implied in <i>Semnonum: the Semnonians inhabit a hundred
villages</i>, is the idea.</p>

<p id="id00704" style="margin-top: 2em">XL. <i>Langobardos</i>. The Lombards of Mediaeval history; so called probably
from their long beards (Germ, lang and bart). First mentioned by
Velleius, 2, 106: gens etiam Germana feritate ferocior. See also Ann. 2,
45, 46, 62-64.—<i>Paucitas</i> here stands opposed to the <i>magno corpore</i> of
the Semnones in 39.</p>

<p id="id00705"><i>Per—periclitando</i>. Three different constructions, cf. notes 16, 18.</p>

<p id="id00706"><i>Reudigni</i>. Perhaps the Jutes, so intimately associated with the Angles
in subsequent history. See Or. in loc. In like manner, Zeuss identifies
the <i>Suardones</i> with the Heruli, and the <i>Nuithones</i> with the Teutones.
<i>Suardones</i> perhaps==<i>sword</i>-men.</p>

<p id="id00707"><i>Anglii</i>. The English reader will here recognize the tribe of Germans
that subsequently invaded, peopled, and gave name to England
(==<i>Angl-land</i>), commonly designated as the Anglo-Saxons. T. does not
mention the <i>Saxons</i>. They are mentioned by Ptolemy and others, as
originally occupying a territory in this same part of Germany. They
became at length so powerful, as to give their name to the entire
confederacy (including the Angles), which ruled northern Germany, as the
Franks (the founders of the French monarchy) did southern. The Angles
seem to have dwelt on the right bank of the Elbe, near its mouth, in the
time of T.</p>

<p id="id00708"><i>Nerthum</i>. This is the reading of the MSS. and the old editions. It
cannot be doubted that T. speaks of Hertha (see Turn. His. Ang. Sax.,
App. to B. 2. chap. 3). "But we must take care not to correct our author
himself." Passow. Grimm identifies this deity with Niördhr of the Edda,
and derives the name from Nord (North).—<i>Terram matrem</i>. The Earth is
worshipped by almost all heathen nations, as the mother of men and the
inferior gods. See Mur. in loco. Cf. 2: Tuisconem Deum, <i>terra editum</i>;
also note, 9. Isidi.</p>

<p id="id00709"><i>Insula</i>. Scholars differ as to the Island. Probabilities perhaps are in
favor of Rugen, where the <i>secretus lacus</i> mentioned below is still
shown, still associated with superstitious legends.</p>

<p id="id00710"><i>Castum. Polluted by nothing profane</i>. So Hor: <i>castis lucis</i>.</p>

<p id="id00711"><i>Penetrali</i>, viz. <i>the sacred vehicle</i>.</p>

<p id="id00712"><i>Dignatur</i>. <i>Deems worthy</i> of her visits.</p>

<p id="id00713"><i>Templo</i>, sc. the sacred grove. Templum, like [Greek: temenos], denotes
any place <i>set apart</i> (from [Greek: temno]) for sacred purposes, cf. 9.</p>

<p id="id00714"><i>Numen ipsum. The goddess herself</i>, not an image of her; for the Germans
have no images of their gods, 9. <i>Abluitur</i>, as if contaminated by
intercourse with mortals.</p>

<p id="id00715"><i>Perituri</i>, etc. <i>Which can be seen only on penalty of death</i>.</p>

<p id="id00716" style="margin-top: 2em">XLI. <i>Propior</i>, sc. to the Romans.—<i>Hermundurorum</i>. Ritter identifies
the name (<i>Hermun</i> being omitted, and <i>dur</i> being==<i>thur</i>) and the people
with the _Thur_ingians. Cf. note 2: <i>Ingaevones</i>.</p>

<p id="id00717"><i>Non in ripa. Not only</i> (or <i>not so much</i>) <i>on the border</i> (the
riverbank), but also within the bounds of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p id="id00718"><i>Splendidissima—colonia</i>. This flourishing colony had no distinctive
name in the age of T.; called afterwards Augusta Vindelicorum, now
Augsburg.</p>

<p id="id00719"><i>Passim</i>. Wherever they chose—<i>Sine custode</i>. Not so others. Cf. His. 4,
64: ut inermes ac prope nudi, <i>sub custode</i> et pretio coiremus.</p>

<p id="id00720"><i>Cum—ostendamus. Cum==while, although</i>. Hence the subj.</p>

<p id="id00721"><i>Non concupiscentibus. Since they were not covetous</i>, Gün. Gr renders:
<i>though they were not equally desirous of it</i>.</p>

<p id="id00722"><i>Notum—auditur</i>. The Elbe had been <i>seen</i> and <i>crossed</i> by Drusus
Domitius, and Tiberius. But now it was known only by <i>hearsay</i>. See a
like patriotic complaint at the close of 37.</p>

<p id="id00723" style="margin-top: 2em">XLII. <i>Marcomanni</i>==men of the marches. See Latham in loc—<i>Sedes</i>, sc.<br/>

Bohemia.—<i>Pulsis olim Boiis</i>, cf. 28.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00724"><i>Degenerant</i>, sc. <i>a reliquorum virtute</i>, i.e. the Narisci and Quadi
<i>are not unworthy, do not fall short</i> of the bravery of their neighbors.
the Marcomanni.</p>

<p id="id00725"><i>Peragitur</i>. Al. <i>protegitur, porrigitur</i>, &amp;c. Different words are
supplied as the subject of <i>peragitur</i>, e.g. Passow <i>iter</i>.; Rit.
<i>cursus</i>; K. <i>frons</i>. The last is preferable. The meaning is: <i>This
country</i> (sc. of these tribes) <i>is the front</i>, so to speak (i.e. the
part <i>facing the Romans</i>) <i>of Germany, so far as it is formed by the
Danube</i>, i.e. so far as the Danube forms the boundary between Germany
and the Roman Empire.</p>

<p id="id00726"><i>Marobodui</i>. Cf. Ann. 2, 62; Suet. Tib. 37.</p>

<p id="id00727"><i>Externos</i>, sc. reges, viz. the kings of the Hermunduri. Ann. 2, 62.—
<i>Potentia. Power</i> irrespective of right. <i>Potestas</i> is lawful
<i>authority</i>. See note, 7</p>

<p id="id00728"><i>Nec minus valent</i>, sc. being aided by our money, than they would be if
they were reinforced by our arms. This clause in some copies stands at
the beginning of 43.</p>

<p id="id00729" style="margin-top: 2em">XLIII. <i>Retro. Back</i> from the Danube and the Roman border.—<i>Referunt.<br/>

Resemble</i>. Poetical, cf. 20.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00730"><i>Et quod patiuntur</i>, sc. proves that they are not of German origin. They
paid tribute as <i>foreigners</i>. The Gothini were probably a remnant of the
expelled Boii. Cf. note, 28, and Prichard, as there cited. Hence their
Gallic language.</p>

<p id="id00731"><i>Quo magis pudeat</i>. They have iron beyond even most of the Germans (cf.
6), but (shame to tell) do not know how to use it in asserting their
independence. Subj. H. 497; Z. 536.</p>

<p id="id00732"><i>Pauca campestrium</i>. Poetical, but not uncommon in the later Latin. So
41: secretiora Germaniae; His. 4, 28: extrema Galliarum. H. 396, III.
2. 3; Z. 435.</p>

<p id="id00733"><i>Jugum. A mountain chain.—Vertices. Distinct summits</i>.</p>

<p id="id00734"><i>Insederunt</i>. This word usually takes a dat., or an abl., with <i>in</i>. But
the poets and later prose writers use it as a transitive verb with the
acc.==<i>have settled, inhabited</i>. Cf. H. 371, 4; Z. 386; and Freund sub
voce. Observe the comparatively unusual form of the perf. 3d plur. in
<i>-erunt</i> instead of <i>-ere</i>. Cf. note, His. 2, 20.</p>

<p id="id00735"><i>Nomen</i>==gens. So nomen Latinum==Latins. Liv. pass.</p>

<p id="id00736"><i>Interpretatione Romana</i>. So we are every where to understand Roman
accounts of the gods of other nations. They transferred to them the names
of their own divinities according to some slight, perhaps fancied
resemblance. Cf. note, 34: <i>quicquid consensimus</i>.</p>

<p id="id00737"><i>Ea vis numini</i>, i.e. these gods render the same service to the Germans,
as Castor and Pollux to the Romans.</p>

<p id="id00738"><i>Alcis</i>, dat. pl. Perhaps from the Slavonic word holcy==kouros, Greek
for Castor and Pollux. Referable to no German root.</p>

<p id="id00739"><i>Peregrinae</i>, sc. Greek or Roman.—<i>Tamen</i>. Though these gods bear no
visible trace of Greek or Roman origin, <i>yet</i> they are worshipped as
brothers, as youth, like the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman Twins</i>.—
<i>Superstitionis</i>==religionis. Cf. notes, His. 3, 58; 5, 13.</p>

<p id="id00740"><i>Lenocinantur. Cherish</i>, increase. Used rhetorically; properly, <i>to
pander</i>.—<i>Arte</i>, sc. nigra scuta, &amp;c.—<i>Tempore</i>, sc. atras noctes, &amp;c.
—<i>Tincta==tattooed</i>.</p>

<p id="id00741"><i>Ipsaque formidine</i>, etc. <i>And by the very frightfulness and shadow of
the deathlike army. Umbra</i> may be taken of the literal <i>shadows</i> of the
men in the night, with Rit., or with Död. and Or., of the general <i>image</i>
or <i>aspect</i> of the army. <i>Feralis</i>, as an adj., is found only in poetry
and post-Augustan prose. See Freund.</p>

<p id="id00742"><i>Gothones</i>. Probably the Getae of earlier, and the Goths of later
history. See Or. in loc. and Grimm and other authorities as there cited.
The <i>Rugii</i> have perpetuated their name in an island of the Baltic
(Rugen).</p>

<p id="id00743"><i>Adductius</i>. Lit. with tighter rein, <i>with more absolute power</i> cf. His.
3, 7: adductius, quam civili bello, imperitabat. The adv. is used only in
the comp.; and the part. adductus is post-Augustan. <i>Jam</i> and <i>nondum</i>
both have reference to the writer's progress in going over the tribes of
Germany, those tribes growing less and less free as he advances eastward:
<i>already</i> under more subjection than the foregoing tribes, but <i>not yet</i>
in such abject slavery, as some we shall soon reach, sc. in the next
chapter, where see note on <i>jam</i>.</p>

<p id="id00744"><i>Supra</i>. So as to <i>trample down</i> liberty and destroy it.</p>

<p id="id00745"><i>Protinus deinde ab</i>, etc. <i>Next in order, from the ocean</i>, i.e. with
territory beginning from or at the ocean.</p>

<p id="id00746" style="margin-top: 2em">XLIV. <i>Suionum. Swedes</i>. Not mentioned under this name, however, by any
other ancient author.</p>

<p id="id00747"><i>Ipso</i>. The Rugii, &amp;c., mentioned at the close of the previous section,
dwelt <i>by</i> the ocean (<i>ab</i> Oceano); but the <i>Suiones in</i> the ocean (<i>in</i>
Oceano). <i>Ipso</i> marks this antithesis.</p>
