  <body class="x-ebookmaker"><p id="id00748"><i>In Oceano</i>. An island in the Baltic. Sweden was so regarded by the
ancients, cf. 1, note.</p>

<p id="id00749"><i>Utrimque prora. Naves biprorae</i>. Such also had the Veneti, Caes. B.G.
3, 13. Such Germanicus constructed, His. 3, 47. So also the canoes of the
N. Am. Indians.</p>

<p id="id00750"><i>Ministrantur</i>, sc. naves==<i>the ships are not furnished with sails</i>, cf.
His. 4, 12: <i>viros armaque ministrant</i>. Or it may be taken in the more
literal sense: are served, i.e. worked, mannged. Cf. Virg. Aen. 6, 302:
velisque ministrat.—<i>In ordinem. For a row</i>, i.e. so as to form a row,
cf. Z. 314: also Rit. and Död. in loc. The northmen (Danes and Swedes)
became afterwards still more famous for navigation and piratical
excursions, till at length they settled down in great numbers in France
and England.</p>

<p id="id00751"><i>In quibusdam fluminum</i>. Rivers with steep banks require the oars to be
removed in order to approach the bank.</p>

<p id="id00752"><i>Est—honos</i>. Contrary to the usual fact in Germany, cf. 5.</p>

<p id="id00753"><i>Exceptionibus</i>. <i>Limitations</i>.—<i>Jam</i>. Now, i.e. <i>here</i>, opposed to the
<i>foregoing</i> accounts of <i>free states</i> and <i>limited monarchies</i>.</p>

<p id="id00754"><i>Precario</i>. Properly: <i>obtained by entreaty</i>. Hence: <i>dependent on the
will of another</i>, cf. A. 16.—<i>Parendi</i>. A gerund with passive sense,
lit. <i>with no precarious right of being obeyed</i>. So Pass., K., Wr. and
Gün.</p>

<p id="id00755"><i>In promiscuo</i>. The privilege of wearing arms is not conceded to the mass
of the people.—<i>Et quidem</i>==et eo, <i>and that too</i>.</p>

<p id="id00756"><i>Otiosa—manus</i>. Al. <i>otiosae</i> by conjecture. But <i>manus</i>, a collective
noun sing. takes a pl. verb, cf. H. 461, 1; Z. 366.</p>

<p id="id00757"><i>Regia utilitas est</i>==regibus utile est.</p>

<p id="id00758" style="margin-top: 2em">XLV. <i>Pigrum</i>. Cf. A. 10: pigrum et grave. The Northern or Frozen Ocean,
of which T. seems to have heard, though some refer it to the northern
part of the Baltic. See Ky. in loc.</p>

<p id="id00759"><i>Hinc</i>. <i>For this reason</i>, viz. <i>quod extremus</i>, etc.</p>

<p id="id00760"><i>In ortus</i>. <i>Till the risings</i> (pl.) <i>of the sun</i>, i.e. from day to day
successively. It was known in the age of T. that the longest day grew
longer towards the north, till at length it became six months (cf. Plin.
N.H. 2, 77), though T. supposed it to be thus long at a lower latitude
than it really was, cf. A. 12.</p>

<p id="id00761"><i>Sonum—aspici</i>. The aurora borealis, some suppose.</p>

<p id="id00762"><i>Persuasio adjicit</i>. <i>The common belief adds</i>, i.e. <i>it is further
believed</i>, cf. His. 5, 5. 13: persuasio inerat.</p>

<p id="id00763"><i>Illuc—natura</i>. <i>Tantum</i> is to be connected with <i>illuc usque</i>. <i>Thus far
only nature extends</i>. So thought the ancients. Cf. A. 33: <i>in ipso
terrarum ac naturae fine</i>. <i>Et vera fama</i> is parenthetic. The <i>author</i>
endorses this part of the story.</p>

<p id="id00764"><i>Ergo</i> marks a return from the above digression.</p>

<p id="id00765"><i>Suevici maris</i>. <i>The Baltic</i>.</p>

<p id="id00766"><i>Aestyorum</i>==eastern men, modern Esthonians. Their language was probably
neither German nor Briton, but Slavonic.</p>

<p id="id00767"><i>Matrem Deum</i>. Cybele, as the Romans interpreted it, cf. 43.</p>

<p id="id00768"><i>Insigne—gestant</i>. Worn, as <i>amulets</i>.</p>

<p id="id00769"><i>Frumenta laborant</i>, i.e. labor <i>for</i>, or <i>to produce</i>, corn. Cf. Hor.
Epod. 5, 60. <i>Laborare</i> is transitive only in poetry and post-Augustan
prose. <i>Elaborare</i> would imply too much art for the author's purpose. See
Rit. in loc.</p>

<p id="id00770"><i>Succinum</i>. <i>Amber</i>, an important article of commerce in early ages,
combining some vegetable juice (hence the Latin name, from <i>succus</i>) with
some mineral ingredients.—<i>Glesum</i>. This name was transferred to
<i>glass</i>, when it came into use. The root is German. Compare [Greek:
chalaza.] Död.</p>

<p id="id00771"><i>Nec</i>==non tamen. <i>Yet it is not</i>, etc.</p>

<p id="id00772"><i>Ut barbaris</i>. Cf. ut inter barbaros, A. 11. <i>Barbaris</i> is dative in
apposition with <i>iis</i>, which is understood after <i>compertum</i>.</p>

<p id="id00773"><i>Quae—ratio</i>. <i>What power or process of nature</i>.</p>

<p id="id00774"><i>Donec—dedit</i>. Cf. note, 87: <i>affectavere</i>.</p>

<p id="id00775"><i>Plerumque</i>. <i>Often</i>; a limited sense of the word peculiar to
post-Augustan Latin. Cf. G. 13: <i>ipsa plerumque fama bella profligant</i>;
and Freund ad v.</p>

<p id="id00776"><i>Quae—expressa</i>==quorum <i>succus</i> expressus, etc.</p>

<p id="id00777"><i>In tantum</i>. <i>To such a degree</i>. Frequent only in late Latin.</p>

<p id="id00778"><i>A servitute</i>. They fall short of liberty in not being free, like most of
the Germans; and they fall below slavery itself, in that they are slaves
to a woman.</p>

<p id="id00779" style="margin-top: 2em">XLVI. <i>Venedorum et Fennorum</i>. Modern <i>Vends and Finns</i>, or Fen-men. Cf.
Latham in loc.—<i>Ac torpor procerum</i>. <i>The chief men are lazy and
stupid</i>, besides being filthy, like all the rest.</p>

<p id="id00780"><i>Foedantur</i>. Cf. infectos, 4.—<i>Habitum</i>, here personal appearance, cf.
note, 17.—<i>Ex moribus</i>, sc. Sarmatarum.</p>

<p id="id00781"><i>Erigitur</i>. Middle sense. <i>Raise themselves</i>, or <i>rise</i>, cf. evolvuntur,

<p id="id00782"><i>Figunt</i>. Have <i>fixed habitations</i>, in contrast with the Sarmatians, who
lived in carts. Cf. Ann. 13, 54: <i>fixerant domos Frisii</i>. Al. <i>fingunt</i>.</p>

<p id="id00783"><i>Sarmatis</i>. The stock of the modern Russians, cf. 1. note.</p>

<p id="id00784"><i>Cubile</i>. We should expect <i>cubili</i> to correspond with <i>victui</i> and
<i>vestituti</i>. But cf. note 18: referantur; 20: ad patrem, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id00785"><i>Comitantur</i>, i.e. feminae comitantur viris.</p>

<p id="id00786"><i>Ingemere—illaborare</i>. <i>Toil and groan upon houses and lands</i>, i.e. <i>in
building and tilling them</i>; though some understand <i>domibus</i> and <i>agris</i>
as the places in which they toil.</p>

<p id="id00787"><i>Versare</i>. <i>To be constantly employed</i> in increasing the fortune of
themselves and others, agitated meanwhile by hope and fear.</p>

<p id="id00788"><i>Securi</i>. Because they have nothing to lose.</p>

<p id="id00789"><i>Illis</i>. Emphatic. <i>They</i>, unlike others, have no need, &amp;c. Cf. <i>apud
illos</i>, 44.</p>

<p id="id00790"><i>In medium relinquam</i>. Leave for the public, i.e. undecided.</p>

<p id="id00791"><i>Relinquere in medio</i> is the more common expression. Bötticher in his
Lex. Tac. explains it, as equivalent by Zeugma to <i>in medium vocatum
relinquam in medio</i>. So in Greek, <i>en</i> and <i>eis</i> often interchange.</p>

<h3 id="id00792" style="margin-top: 3em">AGRICOLA.</h3>

<p id="id00793" style="margin-top: 2em">The Biography of Agricola was written early in the reign of Trajan (which
commenced A.U.C. 851. A.D. 98), consequently about the same time with the
Germania, though perhaps somewhat later (cf. notes on Germania). This
date is established by inference from the author's own language in the 3d
and the 44th sections (see notes). In the former, he speaks of the dawn
of a better day, which opened indeed with the reign of Nerva, but which
is now brightening constantly under the auspices of Trajan. The use of
the past tense (<i>miscuerit</i>) here in respect to Nerva, and of the present
(<i>augeat</i>) in respect to Trajan, is quite conclusive evidence, that at
the time of writing, the reign of Nerva was past, and that of Trajan had
already begun.</p>

<p id="id00794">The other passage is, if possible, still more clearly demonstrative of
the same date. Here in drawing the same contrast between past tyranny and
present freedom, the author, without mentioning Nerva, records the desire
and hope, which his father-in-law expressed in his hearing, that he might
live to see Trajan elevated to the imperial throne—language very proper
and courtly, if Trajan were already Emperor, but a very awkward
compliment to Nerva, if, as many critics suppose, he were still the
reigning prince.</p>

<p id="id00795">It is objected to this date, that if Nerva were not still living, Tacitus
could not have failed to attach to his name (in § 3.) the epithet
<i>Divus</i>, with which deceased Emperors were usually honored. And from the
omission of this epithet in connection with the name of <i>Nerva</i>, together
with the terms of honor in which <i>Trajan</i> is mentioned, it is inferred
that the piece was written in that brief period of three months, which
intervened between the adoption of Trajan by Nerva, and Nerva's death
(see Brotier and many others). But the application of the epithet in
question, was not a matter of necessity or of universal practice. Its
omission in this case might have been accidental, or might have proceeded
from unknown reasons. And the bare absence of a single word surely cannot
be entitled to much weight, in comparison with the obvious and almost
necessary import of the passages just cited.</p>

<p id="id00796">The primary object of the work is sufficiently obvious. It was to honor
the memory of the writer's excellent father-in-law, Agricola (cf. § 3:
honori Agricolae, mei soceri, destinatus). So far from apologizing for
writing the life of so near a friend, he feels assured that his motives
will be appreciated and his design approved, however imperfect may be its
execution; and he deems an apology necessary for having so long delayed
the performance of that filial duty. After an introduction of singular
beauty and appropriateness (cf. notes), he sketches a brief outline of
the parentage, education, and early life of Agricola, but draws out more
at length the history of his consulship and command in Britain, of which
the following summary, from Hume's History of England, may not be
unprofitable to the student in anticipation: "Agricola was the general,
who finally established the dominion of the Romans in this island. He
governed it in the reigns of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. He carried
his victorious arms northward; defeated the Britons in every encounter,
pierced into the forests and the mountains of Caledonia, reduced every
state to subjection in the southern parts of the island, and chased
before him all the men of fiercer and more intractable spirits, who
deemed war and death itself less intolerable than servitude under the
victors. He defeated them in a decisive action which they fought under
Galgacus; and having fixed a chain of garrisons between the friths of
Clyde and Forth, he cut off the ruder and more barren parts of the island
and secured the Roman province from the incursions of the more barbarous
inhabitants. During these military enterprises, he neglected not the arts
of peace. He introduced laws and civility among the Britons; taught them
to desire and raise all the conveniences of life; reconciled them to the
Roman language and manners; instructed them in letters and science; and
employed every expedient to render those chains which he had forged both
easy and agreeable to them." (His. of Eng. vol. 1.)</p>

<p id="id00797">The history of Agricola during this period is of course the history of
Britain. Accordingly the author prefaces it with an outline of the
geographical features, the situation, soil, climate, productions and, so
far as known to the Romans, the past history of the island. Tacitus
possessed peculiar advantages for being the historian of the early
Britons. His father-in-law was the first to subject the whole island to
the sway of Rome. He traversed the country from south to north at the
head of his armies, explored it with his own eyes, and reported what he
saw to our author with his own lips. He saw the Britons too, in their
native nobleness, in their primitive love of liberty and virtue; before
they had become the slaves of Roman arms, the dupes of Roman arts, or the
victims of Roman vices. A few paragraphs in the concise and nervous style
of Tacitus, have made us quite acquainted with the Britons, as Agricola
found them; and on the whole, we have no reason to be ashamed of the
primaeval inhabitants of the land of our ancestry. They knew their
rights, they prized them, they fought for them bravely and died for them
nobly. More harmony among themselves might have delayed, but could not
have prevented the final catastrophe. Rome in the age of Trajan was
irresistible; and Britain became a Roman province. This portion of the
Agricola of Tacitus, and the Germania of the same author, entitle him to
the peculiar affection and lasting gratitude of those, whose veins flow
with Briton and Anglo-Saxon blood, as the historian, and the contemporary
historian too, of their early fathers. It is a notable providence for us,
nay it is a kind providence for mankind, that has thus preserved from the
pen of the most sagacious and reflecting of all historians an account,
too brief though it be, of the origin and antiquities of the people that
of all others now exert the widest dominion whether in the political or
the moral world, and that have made those countries which were in his day
shrouded in darkness, the radiant points for the moral and spiritual
illumination of our race. "The child is father to the man," and if we
would at this day investigate the elements of English law, we have it on
the authority of Sir William Blackstone, that we must trace them back to
their founders in the customs of the Britons and Germans, as recorded by
Caesar and Tacitus.</p>

<p id="id00798">With the retirement of Agricola from the command in Britain, the author
falls back more into the province of biography. The few occasional
strokes, however, in which the pencil of Tacitus has sketched the
character of Domitian in the background of the picture of Agricola are
the more to be prized, because his history of that reign is lost.</p>

<p id="id00799">In narrating the closing scenes of Agricola's life, Tacitus breathes the
very spirit of an affectionate son, without sacrificing the impartiality
and gravity of the historian, and combines all a mourner's simplicity and
sincerity with all the orator's dignity and eloquence.</p>

<p id="id00800">How tenderly he dwells on the wisdom and goodness of his departed father;
how artlessly he intersperses his own sympathies and regrets, even as if
he were breathing out his sorrows amid a circle of sympathizing friends!
At the same time, how instructive are his reflections, how noble his
sentiments, and how weighty his words, as if he were pronouncing an
eulogium in the hearing of the world and of posterity! The sad experience
of the writer in the very troubles through which he follows Agricola,
conspires with the affectionate remembrance of his own loss in the death
of such a father, to give a tinge of melancholy to the whole biography;
and we should not know where to look for the composition, in which so
perfect a work of art is animated by so warm a heart. In both these
respects, it is decidedly superior to the Germania. It is marked by the
same depth of thought and conciseness in diction, but it is a higher
effort of the writer, while, at the same time, it gives us more insight
into the character of the man. It has less of satire and more of
sentiment. Or if it is not richer in refined sentiments and beautiful
reflections, they are interwoven with the narrative in a manner more easy
and natural. The sentiments seem to be only the language of Agricola's
virtuous heart, and the reflections, we feel, could not fail to occur to
such a mind in the contemplation of such a character. There is also more
ease and flow in the language; for concise as it still is and studied as
it may appear, it seems to be the very style which is best suited to the
subject and most natural to the author. In another writer we might call
it labored and ambitious. But we cannot feel that it cost Tacitus very
much effort. Still less can we charge him with an attempt at display. In
short, an air of confidence in the dignity of the subject, and in the
powers of the author, pervades the entire structure of this fine specimen
of biography. And the reader will not deem that confidence ill-grounded.
He cannot fail to regard this, as among the noblest, if not the very
noblest monument ever reared to the memory of any individual.</p>

<p id="id00801">"We find in it the flower of all the beauties, which T. has scattered
through his other works. It is a chef-d'oeuvre, which satisfies at once
the judgment and the fancy, the imagination and the heart. It is justly
proposed as a model of historical eulogy. The praises bestowed have in
them nothing vague or far-fetched, they rise from the simple facts of the
narrative. Every thing produces attachment, every thing conveys
instruction. The reader loves Agricola, admires him, conceives a passion
for him, accompanies him in his campaigns, shares in his disgrace and
profits by his example. The interest goes on growing to the last. And
when it seems incapable of further increase, passages pathetic and
sublime transport the soul out of itself, and leave it the power of
feeling only to detest the tyrant, and to melt into tenderness without
weakness over the destiny of the hero." (La Bletterie.)</p>

<p id="id00802">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p id="id00803">I. <i>Usitatum</i>. A participle in the acc. agreeing with the preceding
clause, and forming with that clause the object of the verb omisit.—
<i>Nequidem</i>. Cf. G. 6, note.</p>

<p id="id00804"><i>Incuriosa suorum</i>. So Ann. 2, 88: dum vetera extollimus, recentium
incuriosi. <i>Incuriosus</i> is post-Augustan.</p>

<p id="id00805"><i>Virtus vicit—vitium</i>. Alliteration, which is not unfrequent in T. as
also homoeoteleuta, words ending with like sounds. Dr.</p>

<p id="id00806"><i>Ignorantiam—invidiam</i>. The gen. <i>recti</i> limits both subs., which
properly denote different faults, but since they are usually associated,
they are here spoken of as one (<i>vitium</i>).</p>

<p id="id00807"><i>In aperto</i>. Literally, <i>in the open</i> field or way; hence, <i>free from
obstructions</i>. Sal. (Jug. 5) uses it for <i>in open</i> day, or clear light.
But that sense would be inappropriate here. <i>Easy</i>. Not essentially
different from <i>pronum</i>, which properly means <i>inclined</i>, and hence
<i>easy</i>. These two words are brought together in like manner in other
passages of our author, cf. 33: vota virtusque <i>in aperto</i>, omniaque
<i>prona</i> victoribus. An inelegant imitation may be thus expressed in
English: down-hill and open-ground work.</p>

<p id="id00808"><i>Sine gratia aut ambitione. Without courting favor or seeking preferment.
Gratia</i> properly refers more to the present, <i>ambitio</i> to the future. Cf.
Ann. 6, 46: Tiberio non perinde gratia praesentium, quam in posteros
ambitio. <i>Ambitio</i> is here used in a bad sense (as it is sometimes in
Cic.) For still another bad sense of the word, cf. G. 27.</p>

<p id="id00809"><i>Celeberrimus quisque</i>. Such men as Pliny the elder, Claudius Pollio,
and Julius Secundus, wrote biographies. Also Rusticus and Senecio. See
chap. 2.</p>

<p id="id00810"><i>Plerique</i>. Not most persons, but <i>many</i>, or <i>very many</i>. Cf. His. 1, 86,
and 4, 84, where it denotes a less number than <i>plures</i> and <i>plurimi</i>, to
which it is allied in its root (ple, ple-us, plus, plerus. See Freund ad
v.)</p>

<p id="id00811"><i>Suam ipsi vitam. Autobiography</i>. Cic. in his Epist. to Lucceius says: If
I cannot obtain this favor from you, I shall perhaps be compelled to
write my own biography, <i>multorum exemplo et clarorum virorum</i>. When
<i>ipse</i> is joined to a possessive pronoun in a reflexive clause, it takes
the case of the subject of the clause. Cf. Z. 696, Note; H. 452, 1.</p>

<p id="id00812"><i>Fiduciam morum</i>. <i>A mark of conscious integrity</i>; literally confidence
of, i.e. in their morals. <i>Morum</i> is objective gen. For the two
accusatives (one of which however is the clause <i>suam—narrare</i>) after
<i>arbitrati sunt</i>, see Z. 394; H. 373. A gen. may take the place of the
latter acc., <i>esse</i> being understood, Z. 448.</p>

<p id="id00813"><i>Rutilio</i>. Rutilius Rufus, consul A.U.C. 649, whom Cic. (Brut. 30, 114.)
names as a profound scholar in Greek literature and philosophy, and
Velleius (2, 13, 2.) calls the best man, not merely of his own, but of
any age. He wrote a Roman history in Greek. Plut. Mar. 28. His
autobiography is mentioned only by Tacitus.</p>

<p id="id00814"><i>Scauro</i>. M. Aemilius Scaurus, consul A.U.C. 639, who wrote an
autobiography, which Cic. (Brut. 29, 112.) compares favorably with the
Cyropaedia of Xenophon.</p>

<p id="id00815"><i>Citra fidem</i>. Cf. note G. 16.—<i>Aut obtrectationi</i>. Enallage, cf. note,
G. 15. Render: <i>This in the case of Rutilius and Scaurus did not impair</i>
(public) <i>confidence or incur</i> (public) <i>censure</i>.</p>

<p id="id00816"><i>Adeo</i>. <i>To such a degree</i>, or <i>so true it is</i>. <i>Adeo</i> conclusiva, et in
initio sententiae collocata, ad <i>mediam</i> latinitatem pertinet. Dr. Livy
uses <i>adeo</i> in this way often; Cic. uses <i>tantum</i>.</p>

<p id="id00817"><i>At nunc</i>, etc. <i>But now</i> (in our age so different from those better
days) <i>in undertaking to write</i> (i.e. if I had undertaken to write) <i>the
life of a man at the time of his death, I should have needed permission;
which I would not have asked</i>, since in that case <i>I should have fallen
on times so cruel and hostile to virtue</i>. The reference is particularly
to the time of Domitian, whose jealousy perhaps occasioned the death of
Agricola, and would have been offended by the very asking of permission
to write his biography. Accordingly the historian proceeds in the next
chapter to illustrate the treatment, which the biographers of eminent men
met with from that cruel tyrant. <i>Opus fuit</i> stands instead of <i>opus
fuisset</i>. Cf. His. 1, 16: <i>dignus eram</i>; 3, 22: <i>ratio fuit</i>; and Z. 518,
519. The concise mode of using the future participles <i>narraturo</i> and
<i>incursaturus</i> (in place of the verb in the proper mood and with the
proper conjunctions, if, when, since) belongs to the silver age, and is
foreign to the language of Cicero. Such is the interpretation, which
after a thorough reinvestigation, I am now inclined to apply to this much
disputed passage. It is that of Ritter. It will be seen that the text
also differs slightly from that of the first edition (<i>in-cursaturus</i>
instead of <i>ni cursaturus</i>). Besides the authority of Rit., Död., Freund
and others, I have been influenced by a regard to the usage of Tacitus,
which lends no sanction to a transitive sense of <i>cursare</i>. Cf. Ann. 15,
50; His. 5, 20. In many editions, <i>mihi</i> stands before <i>nunc narraturo</i>.
But <i>nunc</i> is the emphatic word, and should stand first, as it does in
the best MSS.</p>

<p id="id00818" style="margin-top: 2em">II. <i>Legimus</i>. Quis? Tacitus ejusdemque aetatis homines alii. Ubi? In
actis diurnis. Wr. These <i>journals</i> (Fiske's Man. p. 626., 4. ed.)
published such events (cf. Dio. 67, 11), and were read through the empire
(Ann. 16, 22). T. was absent from Rome when the events here referred to
took place (cf. 45: longae absentiae). Hence the propriety of his saying
<i>legimus</i>, rather than <i>vidimus</i> or <i>meminimus</i>, which have been proposed
as corrections.</p>

<p id="id00819"><i>Aruleno Rustico</i>. Put to death by Domitian for writing a memoir or
penegyric on Paetus Thrasea, cf. Suet. Dom. 10.</p>

<p id="id00820"><i>Paetus Thrasea</i>. Cf. Ann. 16, 21: Trucidatis tot insignibus viris, ad
postremum Nero <i>virtutem ipsam</i> exscindere concupivit, interfecto Thrasea
Paeto.</p>

<p id="id00821"><i>Herennio Senecioni</i>. Cf. Plin. (Epist. 7, 19), where Senecio is said to
have written the life of Helvidius at the request of Fannia, wife of
Helvidius, who was also banished, as accessory to the crime, but who bore
into exile the very books which had been the cause of her exile. For the
dat. cf. note, G. 3: <i>Ulixi</i>.</p>

<p id="id00822"><i>Priscus Helvidius</i>, son-in-law of Thrasea and friend of the younger
Pliny, was put to death by Vespasian. Suet. Vesp. 15; His. 4, 5; Juv.
Sat. 5, 36.</p>

<p id="id00823"><i>Laudati essent</i>. The imp. and plup. subj. are used in narration after
<i>cum</i>, even when it denotes time merely. Here however a causal connection
is also intended. H. 518, II.; Z. 577, 578.</p>

<p id="id00824"><i>Triumviris</i>. The Triumviri at Rome, like the Undecimviri (<i>oi endeka</i>)
at Athens, had charge of the prisons and executions, for which purpose
they had eight lictors at their command.</p>

<p id="id00825"><i>Comitio ac foro</i>. The comitium was a <i>part</i> of the forum. Yet the words
are often used together (cf. Suet. Caes. 10). The <i>comitium</i> was the
proper place for the punishment of criminals, and the word <i>forum</i>
suggests the further idea of the publicity of the book-burning in the
presence of the assembled people.</p>

<p id="id00826"><i>Conscientiam</i>, etc. <i>The consciousness</i>, i.e. <i>common knowledge of
mankind</i>; for <i>conscientia</i> denotes what one knows in common with others,
as well as what he is conscious of in himself. Cf. His. 1, 25:
<i>conscientiam facinoris</i>; Cic. Cat. 1. 1: <i>omnium horum conscientia</i>. In
his Annals (4, 35), T. ridicules the stupidity of those who expect by any
<i>present</i> power, to extinguish the memory also of the <i>next</i> generation.
The sentiment of both passages is just and fine.</p>

<p id="id00827"><i>Sapientiae professoribus. Philosophers</i>, who were banished by Domitian,
A.D. 94, on the occasion of Rusticus's panegyric on Thrasea. T. not
unfrequently introduces an <i>additional circumstance</i> by the abl. abs., as
here.</p>

<p id="id00828"><i>Ne occurreret. Ne</i> with the subj. expresses a negative intention; <i>ut
non</i> a negative result. H. 490; Z. 532.</p>

<p id="id00829"><i>Inquisitiones. A system of espionage</i>, sc. by the Emperor's tools and
informers.—<i>Et</i>==etiam, <i>even</i>. Cf. note, 11. Al. <i>etiam</i>.</p>

<p id="id00830"><i>Memoriam—perdidissemus</i>, i.e. we should not have <i>dared</i> to remember, if
we could have helped it.</p>

<p id="id00831">III. <i>Et quanquam. Et</i> pro <i>sed</i>. So Dr. But <i>nunc demum animus redit</i>
implies, that confidence is hardly restored yet; and the reason for so
slow a recovery is given in the following clause. Hence <i>et</i> is used in
its proper copulative or explicative sense. So Wr. <i>Demum</i> is a
lengthened form of the demonstrative <i>dem</i>. Cf. i-<i>dem</i>, tan-<i>dem</i>,
<i>dae</i>. <i>Nunc demum</i>==<i>nun dae</i>. Freund.</p>

<p id="id00832"><i>Primo statim. Statim</i> gives emphasis: <i>at the very commencement</i>, etc.;
cf. note, 20.—<i>Dissociabiles, incompatible</i>.</p>

<p id="id00833"><i>Augeatque—Trajanus</i>. This marks the date of the composition early in
the reign of Trajan, cf. G. 37; also p. 139 supra.</p>

<p id="id00834"><i>Securitas publica. "And public security has assumed not only hopes and
wishes, but has seen those wishes arise to confidence and, stability.
Securitas publica</i> was a current expression and wish, and was frequently
inscribed on medals." Ky.</p>

<p id="id00835"><i>Assumpserit</i>. This word properly belongs only to <i>fiduciam ac robur.
Spem ac votum</i> would require rather <i>conceperit</i>. Zeugma.</p>

<p id="id00836"><i>Subit</i>. <i>Steals in</i>, lit. creeps under. Cf. note, H. 1, 13.</p>

<p id="id00837"><i>Invisa primo—amatur</i>. The original perhaps of Pope's lines Vice is a
monster, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id00838"><i>Quindecim annos</i>. The reign of Domitian from A.D. 81, to A.D. 96.</p>

<p id="id00839"><i>Fortuitis casibus</i>. Natural and ordinary death, as opposed to death by
violence, <i>saevitia principis</i>.—<i>Promptissimus quisque. The ablest, or
all the ablest</i>. <i>Quisque</i> with a superlative, whether singular or
plural, is in general equivalent to <i>omnes</i> with the positive, with the
additional idea however of a reciprocal comparison among the persons
denoted by <i>quisque</i>, Z. 710, 6.</p>

<p id="id00840"><i>Ut ita dixerim</i>. An apology for the strong expression <i>nostri
superstites: survivors not of others only, but so to speak, of ourselves
also</i>; for we can hardly be said to have <i>lived</i> under the tyranny of
Dom., and our present happy life is, as it were, a renewed existence,
after being buried for fifteen years. A beautiful conception! The use of
<i>dixerim</i> in preference to <i>dicam</i> in this formula is characteristic of
the later Latin. Cf. Z. 528. The <i>et</i> before this clause is omitted by
some editors. But it is susceptible of an explanation, which adds spirit
to the passage: A few of us survive, <i>and that</i> not merely ourselves, but
so to speak, others also. In the Augustan age <i>superstes</i> was, for the
most part, followed by the dative.</p>

<p id="id00841"><i>Tamen</i>. Notwithstanding the unfavorable circumstances in which I write,
after so long a period of deathlike silence, in winch we have almost lost
the gift of speech, <i>yet</i> I shall not regret to have composed <i>even in
rude and inelegant language</i>, etc. For the construction of <i>pigebit</i>, cf.
Z. 441, and H. 410, 6.</p>

<p id="id00842"><i>Memoriam—composuisse</i>. Supposed to refer to his forthcoming history,
written, or planned and announced, but not yet published. Some understand
it of the present treatise. But then <i>interim</i> would have no meaning; nor
indeed is the language applicable to his <i>Agricola</i>.</p>

<p id="id00843"><i>Interim</i>, sc. <i>editus</i> or vulgatus, <i>published meanwhile</i>, i.e. while
preparing the history.</p>

<p id="id00844">The reader cannot but be struck with the beauty of this introduction. It
is modest, and at the same time replete with the dignity of conscious
worth. It is drawn out to considerable length, yet it is all so pertinent
and tasteful, that we would not spare a sentence or a word. With all the
thoughtful and sententious brevity of the exordiums of Sallust, it has
far more of natural ease and the beauty of appropriateness.</p>

<p id="id00845" style="margin-top: 2em">IV. <i>Cnaeus Julius Agricola</i>. Every Roman had at least three names: the
nomen or name of the gens, which always ended in <i>ius</i> (Julius); the
praenomen or individual name ending in <i>us</i> (Cnaeus); and the cognomen or
family name (Agricola). See a brief account of A. in Dion Cassius 66, 20.
Mentioned only by Dion and T. Al. Gnaeus, C. and G. being originally
identical.</p>

<p id="id00846"><i>Forojuliensium colonia</i>. Now <i>Frejus</i>. A walled town of Gallia
Narbonensis, built by Julius Caesar, and used as a <i>naval station</i> by
Augustus (cf. His. 3, 43: <i>claustra maris</i>). Augustus sent thither the
beaked ships captured in the battle of Actium, Ann. 4, 5. Hence perhaps
called <i>illustris</i>.</p>

<p id="id00847"><i>Procuratorem Caesarum</i>. Collector of imperial revenues in the Roman
Provinces.</p>

<p id="id00848"><i>Quae equestris—est</i>, i.e. the procurator was, as we say, ex officio, a
Roman knight. The office was not conferred on senators.</p>

<p id="id00849"><i>Julius Graecinus</i>. Cf. Sen. de Benef. 2, 21: Si exemplo magni animi opus
est, utemur <i>Graecini Julii</i>, viri egregii, quem C. Caesar occidit ob hoc
unum, quod melior vir esset, quam esse quemquam tyranno expediret.</p>

<p id="id00850"><i>Senatorii ordinis</i>. Pred. after <i>fuit</i> understood, with ellipsis of
<i>vir</i>. H. 402, III.; Z. 426.</p>

<p id="id00851"><i>Sapientiae. Philosophy</i>, cf. 1.—<i>Caii Caesaris</i>. Known in English
histories by the name of Caligula.</p>

<p id="id00852"><i>Marcum Silanum</i>. Father-in-law of Caligula, cf. Suet. Calig. 23: Silanum
item <i>socerum</i> ad necem, secandasque novacula fauces compulit.</p>

<p id="id00853"><i>Jussus</i>. Supply <i>est</i>. T. often omits <i>est</i> in the first of two passive
verbs, cf. 9: detentus ac statim … revocatus est. In Hand's Tursellinus
(2, 474) however, jussus is explained as a participle, and <i>quia
abnuerat</i> as equivalent to another participle==<i>having been commanded
and having refused</i>.</p>

<p id="id00854"><i>Abnuerat</i>, lit. <i>had</i> refused, because the refusal was prior to the
slaying. We, with less accuracy, say <i>refused</i>. Z. 505.</p>

<p id="id00855"><i>Rarae castitatis</i>. Ellipsis of <i>mulier</i>. H. 402, III.; Z. 426.</p>

<p id="id00856"><i>In—indulgentiaque. Brought up in her bosom and tender love. Indulgentia</i>
is more frequently used to denote excessive tenderness.</p>

<p id="id00857"><i>Arcebat</i> has for its subject the clause, <i>quod statim</i>, etc. He was
guarded against the allurements of vice by the wholesome influences
thrown around him in the place of his early education.</p>

<p id="id00858"><i>Massiliam</i>. Now Marseilles. It was settled by a colony of Phocaeans.
Hence <i>Graeca comitate</i>. Cf also Cicero's account of the high culture and
refinement of Massilia (Cic. pro Flacco, 26).—<i>Provinciali parsimonia.
Parsimonia</i> in a good sense; <i>economy</i>, as opposed to the luxury and
extravagance of Italy and the City.</p>

<p id="id00859"><i>Locum—mixtum</i>. Enallage for <i>locus</i>, in quo mixta erant, etc. H. 704,
III., cf. 25: mixti copiis et laetitia.—<i>Bene compositum</i> denotes <i>a
happy combination</i> of the elements, of which <i>mixtum</i> expresses only the
<i>co-existence</i>.</p>

<p id="id00860"><i>Acrius</i>, sc. aequo==too eagerly. H. 444, 1, and Z. 104, 1. note.</p>

<p id="id00861"><i>Concessum—senatori</i>. Military and civil studies were deemed more
appropriate to noble Roman youth, than literature and philosophy.
<i>Senatori</i> must of course refer, not to the office of A., but to his rank
by birth, cf. <i>senatorii ordinis</i> above.</p>

<p id="id00862"><i>Hausisse, ni—coercuisset</i>. An analysis of this sentence shows, that
there is an ellipsis of <i>hausurum</i> fuisse: <i>he imbibed</i>, and would have
continued to imbibe, <i>had not</i>, &amp;c. In such sentences, which abound in T.
but are rarely found in Cic., <i>ni</i> is more readily translated by <i>but</i>.
Cf. Z. 519. <i>b</i>; and note, His. 3, 28. For the application of <i>haurire</i>
to the eager study of philosophy, cf. Hor. Sat. 2, 4, 95: <i>haurire vitae
praecepta beatae</i>, and note, His. 1, 51: <i>hauserunt animo</i>.</p>

<p id="id00863"><i>Prudentia matris</i>. So Nero's mother deterred him from the study of
philosophy. Suet. Ner. 52.</p>

<p id="id00864"><i>Pulchritudinem ac speciem. The beautiful image</i>, or beau ideal, by
hendiadys. Cf. Cic. Or. 2: <i>species pulchritudinis</i>. See Rit. in loc.</p>

<p id="id00865"><i>Vehementius quam caute</i>. For <i>vehementius quam cautius</i>, which is the
regular Latin construction. T. uses both. Cf. Z. 690, and note, His. 1,
83.</p>

<p id="id00866"><i>Mox</i>. In T. subsequently, not presently. R.</p>

<p id="id00867"><i>Retinuitque—modum. And, what is most difficult, he retained from
philosophy moderation</i>—moderation in all things, but especially in
devotion to philosophy itself, where moderation is difficult in
proportion to the excellence of the pursuit, as was shown by the
extravagance of the Stoics and some other Grecian sects. As to the sense
of <i>modum</i>, cf. Hor. Sat. 1, 1, 106: <i>est modus in rebus</i>; and for the
sentiment, Hor. Ep. 1, 6, 15: <i>Insani sapiens nomen ferat, aequus iniqui,
ultra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam</i>.</p>

<p id="id00868" style="margin-top: 2em">V. <i>Castrorum</i>. This word is used to express whatever pertains to
military life, education, &amp;c., as the context may require. Every Roman
youth who aspired to civil office, must have a military education.</p>

<p id="id00869"><i>Diligenti ac moderato. Careful and prudent</i>, cf. our author's character
of the same commander, His. 2, 25: <i>cunctator natura</i>, etc.</p>

<p id="id00870"><i>Approbavit</i>==fecit, ut ei probarentur. Dr. It is a constructio
praegnans. He obtained the first rudiments of a military education under
Paullinus, and he gained his approbation.</p>

<p id="id00871"><i>Electus—aestimaret. Having been chosen as one whom he would estimate</i>
(i.e. test his merit) <i>by tenting together</i>, i.e. by making him his
companion and aid. Young men of rank and promise were thus associated
with Roman commanders. Cf. Suet., Caes. 2. T., as usual, avoids the
technical way of expressing the relation. Ad verbum, <i>contubernium</i>, cf.
note, His. 1, 43. Others make <i>aestimaret==dignum aestimaret</i>, and
<i>contubernio</i> abl. of price. Cf. Död. and Dr.</p>

<p id="id00872"><i>Licenter—segniter</i>, sc. agens. <i>Licenter</i> refers to <i>voluptates,
segniter</i> to <i>commeatus.—Commeatus==furloughs, absence from duty.—
Inscitiam</i>, sc. tribunatus==<i>ignorance of his official duty or
inexperience in war.—Retulit. Referre ad</i> is used very much like the
corresponding English, viz. to <i>refer to</i> an object, or devote to an end.
Sense: <i>He did not take advantage of his official standing and his
military inexperience, to give up his time to ease and pleasure</i>. Wr.
takes <i>retulit</i> in the more ordinary sense of brought back, thus: A. did
not bring back (to Rome) the empty name of Tribune and no military
experience, there to give himself up to leisure and pleasure. The former
version accords better with the language of the whole passage. Wr.
questions the authority for such a use of <i>referre</i>. But it may be found,
e.g. Plin. Epist. 1, 22: nihil <i>ad</i> ostentationem, omnia <i>ad</i>
conscientiam <i>refert</i>.</p>

<p id="id00873"><i>Noscere—nosci</i>, etc. T. is fond of such a series of inf. depending on
some <i>one</i> finite verb understood, and hence closely connected with each
other, cf. G. 30: <i>praeponere</i>, etc. <i>note</i>. Here supply from <i>retulit</i>
in the preceding number the idea: <i>he made it his business or aim to
know</i>, etc. The author's fondness for antithesis is very observable in
the several successive pairs here: <i>noscere—nosci; discere—sequi;
appetere—recusare; anxius—intentus</i>.</p>

<p id="id00874"><i>In jactationem</i>. Al. jactatione. <i>In</i> denoting the object or purpose, Z.
314: <i>he coveted no appointment for the sake of display; he declined none
through fear</i>.</p>

<p id="id00875"><i>Anxius</i> and <i>intentus</i> qualify <i>agere</i> like adverbs cf. R. Exc. 23, 1.
<i>He conducted himself both with prudence and with energy</i>.</p>

<p id="id00876"><i>Exercitatior</i>==agitatior. So Cic. Som. Scip. 4: agitatus et exercitatus
animus; and Hor. Epod. 9, 31: Syrtes Noto exercitatas.</p>

<p id="id00877"><i>Incensae coloniae</i>. Camalodunum, Londinium and Verulamium. Cf. Ann. 14,
33, where however the historian does not expressly say, the last two were
<i>burned</i>.</p>

<p id="id00878"><i>In ambiguo</i>==ambigua, in a critical state. R.</p>

<p id="id00879"><i>Alterius</i>, sc. ducis.—<i>Artem et usum</i>. Military <i>science and
experience</i>.</p>

<p id="id00880"><i>Summa … cessit. The general management</i> (cf. notes, H. 1, 87. 2, 16.
33) <i>and the glory of recovering the province went to the general</i> (to
his credit). The primary meaning of <i>cedere</i> is <i>to go</i>. See Freund sub
v.—<i>Juveni</i>, sc. A.</p>

<p id="id00881"><i>Tum</i>, sc. while veterani trucidarentur, etc.—<i>Mox</i>, sc. when Paullinus
and A. came to the rescue.</p>

<p id="id00882"><i>Nec minus</i>, etc. A remark worthy of notice and too often true.</p>

<p id="id00883" style="margin-top: 2em">VI. <i>Magistratus</i>. The regular <i>course</i> of offices and honors at Rome.</p>

<p id="id00884"><i>Per—anteponendo</i>. Enallage, cf. G. 15, note. <i>Per</i> here denotes manner,
rather than means (cf. <i>per lamenta</i>, 28); and <i>anteponendo</i>
likewise==anteponentes. R. Render: <i>mutually loving and preferring one
another.—Nisi quod==but</i>. Cf. <i>ni</i>, 4. There is an ellipsis before <i>nisi
quod</i>, which R. would supply thus: greatly to the credit of both parties
—<i>but more praise belongs to the good wife</i>, etc. <i>Major</i> sc. quam in
bono viro. So, after <i>plus</i> supply quam in malo viro: <i>But more praise
belongs to a good wife</i>, than to a good husband, <i>by as much as more
blame attaches to a bad wife</i>, than to a bad husband.</p>

<p id="id00885"><i>Sors quaesturae</i>. The Quaestors drew <i>lots</i> for their respective
provinces. Their number increased with the increase of the empire, till
from two they became twenty or more. As at first a Quaestor accompanied
each Consul at the head of an army, so afterwards each Proconsul, or
Governor of a province, had his Quaestor to collect and disburse the
revenues of the province. The Quaestorship was the first in the course of
Roman honors. It might be entered upon at the age of twenty-four.</p>

<p id="id00886"><i>Salvium Titianum</i>. Brother of the Emperor Otho. See His. B. 1 and 2.
pass. For the office of Proconsul, &amp;c., see note, His. 1, 49.</p>

<p id="id00887"><i>Parata peccantibus. Ready for wicked</i> rulers, i.e. affording great
facilities for extortion in its corrupt and servile population. <i>Paratus</i>
With a dat. of the thing, for which there is a preparation, is peculiar
to poetry and post-Augustan prose. Cf. Freund ad v. Ad rem. cf. Cic.
Epist. ad Quint. 1, 1, 6: tam corruptrice provincia, sc. Asia; and pro
Mur. 9.</p>

<p id="id00888"><i>Quantalibet facilitate</i>. Any indulgence (license) however great.</p>

<p id="id00889"><i>Redempturus esset</i>. Subj. in the apodosis answering to a protasis
understood, sc. if A. would have entered into the plot. Cf. H. 502.
Observe the use of <i>esset</i> rather than <i>fuisset</i> to denote what the
proconsul would have been ready to do <i>at any time</i> during their
<i>continuance</i> in office. Cf. Wr. in loc.</p>

<p id="id00890"><i>Dissimulationem</i>. Concealment (of what is true); simulatio, on the
other hand, is an allegation of what is false.</p>

<p id="id00891"><i>Auctus est filia</i>. So Cic. ad Att. 1, 2: filiolo me auctum scito.</p>

<p id="id00892"><i>Ante sublatum. Previously born</i>. For this use of <i>sublatum</i>, see
Lexicon.—Brevi amisit, he lost shortly after_; though R. takes <i>amisit</i>
as perf. for plup. and renders lost a short time before.</p>

<p id="id00893"><i>Mox inter</i>, etc., sc. <i>annum</i> inter, supplied from <i>etiam ipsum …
annum</i> below.</p>

<p id="id00894"><i>Tenor et silentium</i>. Hendiadys for continuum silentium, or tenorem
silentem. R.</p>

<p id="id00895"><i>Jurisdictio. For the administration of justice in private cases had not
fallen to his lot</i>. Only two of the twelve or fifteen Praetors, viz. the
Praetor Urbanus (see note H. 1, 47) and the Praetor Peregrinus (who
judged between foreigners and citizens) were said to exercise
<i>jurisdictio</i>. The adjudication of criminal causes was called <i>quaestio</i>,
which was now for the most part in the hands of the senate (Ann. 4, 6),
from whom it might be transferred by appeal to the Praefect of the City
or the Emperor himself. The Praetors received the <i>jurisdictio</i> or the
<i>quaestio</i> by lot; and in case the former did not fall to them, the
office was almost a sinecure; except that they continued to preside over
the public games. See further, on the name and office of Praetor, His. 1,
47, note. For the plup. in <i>obvenerat</i>, see note, 4: <i>abnuerat</i>.</p>

<p id="id00896"><i>Et</i>==et omnino. <i>The games and in general the pageantry of office
(inania honoris)</i> expected of the Praetor. Observe the use of the neuter
plural of the adj. for the subst., of which, especially before a gen., T.
is peculiarly fond.</p>

<p id="id00897"><i>Medio rationis</i>. The text is doubtful. The MSS. vacillate between <i>medio
ratinois</i> and <i>modo rationis</i>; and the recent editions, for the most
part, follow a third but wholly conjectural reading, viz. <i>moderationis</i>.
The sense is the same with either reading: <i>He conducted the games and
the empty pageantry of office in a happy mean</i> (partaking at once) <i>of
prudence and plenty</i>. See Freund ad <i>duco</i>.</p>

<p id="id00898"><i>Uti—propior. As far from luxury, so</i> (in the same proportion) <i>nearer to
glory</i>, i.e. the farther from luxury, the nearer to glory. Cf. Freund ad
<i>uti</i>.</p>

<p id="id00899"><i>Longe—propior</i>. Enallage of the adv. and adj. ef. G. 18: <i>extra</i>.</p>

<p id="id00900"><i>Ne sensisset. Would not have felt</i>, etc., i.e. he recovered all the
plundered offerings of the temple, but those which had been
sacrilegiously taken away by <i>Nero</i> for the supply of his vicious
pleasures. This explanation supposes a protasis understood, or rather
implied in <i>quam Neronis</i>. (Cf H. 503, 2. 2). The plup. subj. admits
perhaps of another explanation, the subj. denoting the end with a view to
which <i>Agricola labored</i> (H. 531; Z. 549), and the plup. covering all the
past down to the time of his labors: he labored that the republic might
not have experienced, and <i>he</i> virtually <i>effected that it had not
experienced</i>, since he restored everything to its former state, the
plunder of Nero alone excepted. See Wr. and Or. in loc. Perhaps this
would not be an unexampled <i>praegnantia</i> for Tacitus. For <i>sentire</i> in
the sense of <i>experiencing</i> especially <i>evil</i>, see Hor. Od. 2, 7, 10, and
other examples in Freund sub v.</p>

<p id="id00901" style="margin-top: 2em">VII. <i>Classis Othoniana</i>. Ad rem. cf. His. 2, 12, seqq.—<i>Licenter vaga.
Roaming in quest of plunder.—Intemelios</i>, Cf. note, 2, 13.—<i>In
praediis suis. On her own estates. Praedia</i> includes both lands and
buildings.</p>

<p id="id00902"><i>Ad solemnia pietatis. To perform the last offices of filial affection</i>.</p>

<p id="id00903"><i>Nuntio deprehensus</i>. Supply <i>est</i>, cf. 4: jussus. <i>Was overtaken
unexpectedly by the news of Vespasian's claim (nomination) to the

<p id="id00904"><i>Principatus</i>, sc. Vespasiani.—<i>Mucianus regebat</i>. Vesp. was detained in
Egypt for some time after his troops had entered Rome under Mucianus;
meanwhile Mucianus exercised all the imperial power, cf. His. 4, 11. 39:
vis penes Mucianum erat.</p>

<p id="id00905"><i>Juvene—usurpante</i>. Dom. was now eighteen years old, cf. His. 4, 2:
nondum ad curas intentus, sed <i>stupris et adulteriis filium principis
agebat</i>.</p>

<p id="id00906"><i>Is</i>, sc. Mucianus.—<i>Vicesimae legioni</i>. One of three legions, at that
time stationed in <i>Britain</i>, which submitted to the government of Vesp.

<p id="id00907"><i>Decessor. Predecessor</i>. It was Roscius Coelius. His. 1, 60.</p>

<p id="id00908"><i>Legatis—consularibus. Governors</i> or Proconsuls. The provinces were
governed by men who had been consuls (<i>consulares</i>), and as <i>legatus</i>
meant any commissioned officer, these were distinguished as <i>legati
consulares</i>. With reference to this consular authority, the same were
called <i>proconsules</i>. Cf. note, H. 1, 49. Trebellius Maximus and Vettius
Bolanus are here intended. Cf. 16. and His. 1, 60. 2, 65. <i>Nimia</i>==justo
potentior. Dr.</p>

<p id="id00909"><i>Legatus praetorius==legatus legionis, commander of the legion</i>. Cf.
note, His. 1, 7. Here the same person as <i>decessor</i>.</p>

<p id="id00910"><i>Invenisse quam fecisse</i>, etc., involves a maxim of policy worth noting.</p>

<p id="id00911" style="margin-top: 2em">VIII. <i>Placidius. With less energy</i>. See more of Bolanus at close of 16.</p>

<p id="id00912"><i>Dignum est</i>. A general remark, applicable to any such province. Hence
the present, for which some would substitute <i>erat</i> or <i>esset</i>.</p>

<p id="id00913"><i>Ne incresceret</i>, sc. ipse: <i>lest he should become too great</i>, i.e. rise
above his superior and so excite his jealousy. Referred by W. to

superfluous.</p>

<p id="id00921"><i>Vesp.—ascivit</i>. By virtue of his office as Censor, the Emperor claimed
the right of elevating and degrading the rank of the citizens. Inasmuch
as the families of the aristocracy always incline to run out and become
extinct, there was a necessity for an occasional re-supply of the
patrician from the plebeian ranks, e.g. by Julius Caesar, Augustus and
Claudius (Ann. 11, 25), as well as by Vespasian (Aur. Vic. Caes. 9. Suet.
9.)—<i>Provinciae—praeposuit</i>. Aquitania was one of seven provinces, into
which Augustus distributed Gaul, and which with the exception of Narbonne
Gaul, were all subject to the immediate disposal and control of the
Emperor himself. It was the south-western part of Gaul, being enclosed by
the Rhone, the Loire, the Pyrenees and the Atlantic.</p>

<p id="id00922"><i>Splendidae—destinarat. A province of the first importance both in its
government</i> (in itself considered), <i>and the prospect of the consulship,
to which he</i> (Vesp.) <i>had destined him</i> (A.), sc. as soon as his office
should have expired.</p>

<p id="id00923"><i>Subtilitatem</i>==calliditatem, nice discernment, <i>discrimination</i>.—
<i>Exerceat</i>, Observe the subj. to express the views of others, not of the
author. H. 531; Z. 511.</p>

<p id="id00924">_Secura—agens. <i>Requiring less anxious thought and mental acumen</i>, and
<i>proceeding more by physical force. Secura</i>==minus anxia. Dr. Cf. note,
His. 1, 1. <i>Obtusior</i>==minus acuta.</p>

<p id="id00925"><i>Togatos. Civilians</i> in distinction from military men, like A. The <i>toga</i>
was the dress of civil life to some extent in the <i>provinces</i> (cf. 21,
His. 2, 20), though originally worn only in <i>Rome</i>. (Beck. Gall., Exc.
Sc. 8.)</p>

<p id="id00926"><i>Remissionumque</i>. The Greeks and Romans both used the pl. of many
abstracts, of which we use only the sing. For examples see R. Exc. 4. For
the principle cf. Z. 92.</p>

<p id="id00927"><i>Curarum—divisi</i>. This clause means not merely, that his time was
divided between business and relaxation; but that there was a broad
line of demarcation between them, as he proceeds to explain.
<i>Divisa</i>==diversa inter se. Dr. So Virg. Georg. 2, 116: divisae
arboribus patriae==countries are <i>distinguished from</i> each other by
their trees. <i>Jam vero</i>. Cf. note, G. 14.</p>

<p id="id00928"><i>Conventus</i>, sc. juridici==<i>courts</i>. The word designates also the
districts in which the courts were held, and into which each province was
divided. Cf. Smith's Dict. of Ant.: Conventus. So Pliny (N.H. 3; 3.)
speaks of juridici conventus. Tacitus, as usual, avoids the technical
designation.</p>

<p id="id00929"><i>Ultra</i>. Adv. for adj., cf. <i>longe</i>, 6.—<i>Persona</i>. 1. A mask (<i>per</i> and
<i>sono</i>). 2. Outward show, as here.</p>

<p id="id00930"><i>Tristitiam—exuerat</i>. Some connect this clause by zeugma with the
foregoing. But with a misapprehension of the meaning of exuerat,
which==<i>was entirely free from</i>; lit. had divested himself of. Thus
understood, the clause is a <i>general</i> remark touching the character of
A., in implied contrast with other men or magistrates with whom those
vices were so common. So in Ann. 6, 25, Agrippina is said to have
divested herself of vices (<i>vitia exuerat</i>) which were common among
women, but which never attached to her. <i>Facilitas</i>. Opposed to
<i>severitas</i>==kindness, indulgence.</p>

<p id="id00931"><i>Abstinentiam</i>. This word, though sometimes denoting temperance in food
and drink, more properly refers to the desire and use of money.
<i>Abstinentia</i> is opposed to <i>avarice; continentia</i> to <i>sensual pleasure</i>.
Cf. Plin. Epis. 6, 8: alieni abstinentissimus. Here render honesty,
integrity.</p>

<p id="id00932"><i>Cui—indulgent</i>. See the same sentiment, His. 4, 6: quando etiam
sapientibus cupido gloriae novissima exuitur.</p>

<p id="id00933"><i>Ostentanda—artem</i>, cf. 6: <i>per—anteponendo</i>; also G. 15, note.</p>

<p id="id00934"><i>Collegas</i>. The governors of other provinces. The word means <i>chosen
together</i>; hence either those chosen at the same election or those chosen
to the same office. Cf. H. 1, 10.</p>

<p id="id00935"><i>Procuratores</i>. There was but one at a time in each province. There may
have been several however in succession, while A. was Proconsul. Or we
may understand both this clause and the preceding, not of his government
in Aquitania in particular, but as a general fact in the life of A. So E.
For the office, see note, 4; and for an instance of a quarrel between the
Proconsul and the Procurator, Ann. 14, 38.</p>

<p id="id00936"><i>Atteri</i>==vinci as the antithesis shows, though with more of the
implication of dignity <i>impaired</i> (worn off) by conflict with inferiors.</p>

<p id="id00937"><i>Minus triennium. Quam</i> omitted. See H. 417, 3; Z. 485.</p>

<p id="id00942"><i>Perdomita est. Completely subdued</i>.</p>

<p id="id00943"><i>Rerum fide==faithfully and truly</i>; lit. with fidelity to facts.</p>

<p id="id00944"><i>Britannia</i>. It has generally been supposed (though Gesenius denies it in
his Phenician Paloeography) that Britain was known to the Phenicians,
those bold navigators and enterprising merchants of antiquity, under the
name of the <i>Cassiterides</i>, or Tin Islands. Greek authors make early
mention of Albion (plural of Alp?) and Ierne (Erin) as British Islands.
Bochart derives the name (Britain) from the Phenician or Hebrew
Baratanae, "the Land of Tin;" others from the Gallic <i>Britti</i>, Painted,
in allusion to the custom among the inhabitants of painting their bodies.
But according to the Welsh Triads, Britain derived its name from Prydain,
a king, who early reigned in the island. Cf. Turner's His. Ang. Sax. 1,
2, seqq. The geographical description, which follows, cannot be
exonerated from the charge of verbiage and grandiloquence. T. wanted the
art of saying a plain thing plainly.</p>

<p id="id00945"><i>Spatio ac coelo</i>. Brit. not only stretches out or lies over against
these several countries in <i>situation</i>, but it approaches them also in
<i>climate</i>: a circumstance which illustrates the great size of the island
(cf. <i>maxima</i>, above) and prepares the way for the description of both
below.</p>

<p id="id00946"><i>Germaniae</i> and <i>Hispaniae</i> are dat. after <i>obtenditur</i>. The mistaken
notion of the relative position of Spain and Britain is shared with T. by
Caesar (B.G. 13), Dion (39, 50), and indeed by the ancients in general.
It is so represented in maps as late as Richard of Cirencester. Cf.
Prichard, III. 3, 9.</p>

<p id="id00947"><i>Etiam inspicitur</i>. It is even <i>seen</i> by the Gauls, implying nearer
approach to Gaul, than to Germany or Spain.</p>

<p id="id00948"><i>Nullis terris</i>. Abl. abs., <i>contra</i> taking the place of the part., or
rather limiting a part. understood.</p>

<p id="id00949"><i>Livius</i>. In his 105th Book; now lost, except in the Epitome.</p>

<p id="id00950"><i>Fabius Rusticus</i>. A friend of Seneca, and writer of history in the age
of Claudius and Nero.</p>

<p id="id00951"><i>Oblongae scutulae</i>. Geometrically a trapezium.</p>

<p id="id00952"><i>Et est ea facies. And such is the form, exclusive of Caledonia, whence
the account has been extended also to the whole Island</i>.</p>

<p id="id00953"><i>Sed—tenuatur. But a vast and irregular extent of lands jutting out
here (jam</i>, cf. note, G. 44) <i>on this remotest shore</i> (i.e. widening
out again where they seemed already to have come to an end), <i>is
narrowed down as it were into a wedge</i>. The author likens Caledonia to
a wedge with its apex at the Friths of Clyde and Forth, and its base
widening out on either side into the ocean beyond. <i>Enormis</i> is a
post-Augustan word. <i>Novissimi</i>==extreme, remotest. G. 24, note.</p>

<p id="id00954"><i>Affirmavit. Established</i> the fact, hitherto supposed, but not fully
ascertained. This was done in Agricola's last campaign in Britain,
cf. 38.</p>

<p id="id00955"><i>Orcadas</i>. The Orkneys. Their name occurs earlier than this, but they
were little known.</p>

<p id="id00956"><i>Dispecta est. Was seen</i> through the mist, as it were; discovered in the
distance and obscurity. Cf. note, H. 4, 55: dispecturas Gallias, etc.</p>

<p id="id00957"><i>Thule</i>. Al. Thyle. What island T. meant, is uncertain. It has been
referred by different critics, to the Shetland, the Hebrides, and even to
Iceland. The account of the island, like that of the surrounding ocean,
is obviously drawn from the imagination.</p>

<p id="id00958"><i>Nam hactenus</i>, etc. <i>For their orders were</i> to proceed <i>thus far</i> only,
<i>and</i> (besides) <i>winter was approaching</i>. Cf. <i>hactenus</i>, G. 25, and
<i>appetere</i>, Ann. 4, 51: <i>appetente jam luce</i>. The editions generally have
<i>nix</i> instead of <i>jussum</i>. But Rit. and Or. with reason follow the oldest
and best MSS. in the reading <i>jussum</i>, which with the slight and obvious
amendment of <i>nam</i> for <i>quam</i> by Rit. renders this obscure and vexed
passage at length easy and clear.</p>

<p id="id00959"><i>Pigrum et grave</i>. See a similar description of the Northern Ocean, G.
25: pigrum ac prope immotum. The modern reader need not be informed, that
this is an entire mistake, as to the matter of fact; those seas about
Britain are never frozen; though the navigators in this voyage might
easily have magnified the perils and hardships of their enterprise, by
transferring to these waters what they had heard of those further north.</p>

<p id="id00960"><i>Perinde</i>. Al. <i>proinde</i>. These two forms are written indiscriminately in
the old MSS. The meaning of <i>ne perinde</i> here is <i>not so much</i>, sc. as
other seas. Cf. note, G. 5.</p>

<p id="id00961"><i>Ne ventis—attolli</i>. Directly the reverse of the truth. Those seas, are
in fact, remarkably tempestuous.</p>

<p id="id00962"><i>Quod—impellitur</i>. False philosophy to explain a fictitious phenomenon,
as is too often the case with the philosophy of the ancients, who little
understood natural science, cf. the <i>astronomy</i> of T. in 12.</p>

<p id="id00963"><i>Neque—ac</i>. Correlatives. The author assigns two reasons why he does not
discuss the subject of the <i>tides</i>: 1. It does not suit the design of his
work; 2. The subject has been treated by many others, e.g. Strab. 3, 5,
11; Plin. N.H. 2, 99, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id00964"><i>Multum fluminum. Multum</i> is the object of <i>ferre</i>, of which <i>mare</i> is
the subject, as it is also of all the infinitives in the sentence.
<i>Fluminum</i> is not rivers but currents among the islands along the shore.</p>

<p id="id00965"><i>Nec littore tenus</i>, etc. "<i>The ebbings and flowings of the tide are not
confined to the shore, but the sea penetrates into the heart of the
country, and works its way among the hills and mountains, as in its
native bed</i>." Ky. A description very appropriate to a coast so cut up by
aestuaries, and highly poetical, but wanting in simplicity.</p>

<p id="id00966"><i>Jugis etiam ac montibus. Jugis</i>, cf. G. 43. <i>Ac. Atque</i> in the common
editions. But <i>ac</i>, besides being more frequent before a consonant, is
found in the best MSS.</p>

<p id="id00967" style="margin-top: 2em">XI. <i>Indigenae an advecti</i>. Cf. <i>note</i>, G. 2: <i>indigenas</i>.</p>

<p id="id00968"><i>Ut inter barbaros</i>, sc. fieri solet. Cf. ut in licentia, G. 2; and ut
inter Germanos, G. 30.</p>

<p id="id00969"><i>Rutilae—asseverant</i>. Cf. the description of the Germans, G. 4. The
inhabitants of Caledonia are of the same stock as the other Britons. The
conclusion, to which our author inclines below, viz. that the Britons
proceeded from Gaul, is sustained by the authority of modern
ethnologists. The original inhabitants of Britain are found, both by
philological and historical evidence, to have belonged to the Celtic or
Cimmerian stock, which once overspread nearly the whole of central
Europe, but were overrun and pushed off the stage by the Gothic or German
Tribes, and now have their distinct representatives only in the Welsh,
the Irish, the Highland Scotch, and a few similar remnants of a once
powerful race in the extreme west of the continent and the islands of the
sea. Cf. note on the Cimbri, G. 37.</p>

<p id="id00970"><i>Silurum</i>. The people of Wales.</p>

<p id="id00971"><i>Colorati vultus. Dark complexion</i>. So with the poets, colorati Indi,
Seres, Etrusci, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id00972"><i>Hispania</i>. Nom. subject of <i>faciunt</i>, with <i>crines</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="id00973"><i>Iberos</i>. Properly a people on the Iberus (Ebro), who gave their name to
the whole Spanish Peninsula. They belonged to a different race from the
Celtic, or the Teutonic, which seems once to have inhabited Italy and
Sicily, as well as parts of Gaul and Spain. A dialect is still spoken in
the mountainous regions about the Bay of Biscay, and called the Basque or
Biscayan, which differs from any other dialect in Europe. Cf. Prichard's
Physical Researches, vol. III. chap. 2.</p>

<p id="id00974"><i>Proximi Gallis</i>. Cf. Caes. B.G. 5, 14: Ex his omnibus longe sunt
humanissimi, qui Cantium (Kent) incolunt, quae regio est maritima omnis,
<i>neque multum a Gallica differunt consuetudine. Et—also: those nearest
the Gauls are also like them</i>.</p>

<p id="id00975"><i>Durante vi. Either because the influence of a common origin still
continues</i>, etc.</p>

<p id="id00976"><i>Procurrentibus—terris. Or because their territories running out towards
one another</i>, literally, <i>in opposite directions</i>, Britain towards the
south and Gaul towards the north, so as to approach each other. See Rit.,
Död. in loc., and Freund ad <i>diversus</i>.</p>

<p id="id00977"><i>Positio—dedit</i>. The idea of similarity being already expressed in
<i>similes</i>, is understood here: their situation in the same climate
(<i>coelo</i>) has given them the <i>same</i> personal appearance.</p>

<p id="id00978"><i>Aestimanti</i>. Indef. dat. after <i>credibile est</i>, cf. note, G. 6.</p>

<p id="id00979"><i>Eorum</i> refers to the Gauls. You (indef. subject, cf. quiescas, G. 36)
may discover the religion of the Gauls (among the Britons) in their full
belief of the same superstitions. So Caes. B.G. 6, 13: disciplina in
Britannia reperta atque inde in Galliam translata esse existimatur; and
he adds, that those who wished to gain a more perfect knowledge of the
Druidical system still went from Gaul to Britain to learn. Sharon Turner
thinks, the system must have been introduced into Britain from the East
(perhaps India) by the Phenicians, and thence propagated in Gaul. His.
Ang. Sax., B. 1, chap. 5.</p>

<p id="id00980"><i>Persuasione</i>. See the same use of the word, His. 5, 5: eademque de
infernis persuasio.</p>

<p id="id00981"><i>In—periculis</i>. The same sentiment is expressed by Caesar (B.G. 3, 19).</p>

<p id="id00982"><i>Ferociae</i>. In a good sense, courage, cf. 31: virtus ac ferocia.</p>

<p id="id00983"><i>Praeferunt</i>==prae se ferunt, i.e. <i>exhibit</i>.</p>

<p id="id00984"><i>Ut quos. Ut qui</i>, like <i>qui</i> alone, is followed by the subj. to express
a reason for what precedes. It may be rendered by <i>because</i> or <i>since</i>
with the demonstrative. So <i>quippe cui placuisset</i>, 18. Cf. Z. 565 and H.
519, 3.</p>

<p id="id00985"><i>Gallos floruisse</i>. Cf. G. 28.</p>

<p id="id00986"><i>Otio</i>. Opposed to <i>bellis, peace.—Amissa virtute</i>. Abl. abs. denoting
an additional circumstance. Cf. 2: <i>expulsis—professoribus</i>, note.—
<i>Olim</i> limits <i>victis</i>.</p>

<p id="id00987" style="margin-top: 2em">XII. <i>Honestior. The more honorable</i> (i.e. the man of rank) <i>is the
charioteer, his dependents fight</i> (on the chariot). The reverse was true
in the Trojan War.</p>

<p id="id00988"><i>Factionibus trahuntur</i>==distrahuntur in factiones. Dr., and Or. T. is
fond of using simple for compound verbs. See note 22; also numerous
examples in the Index to Notes on the Histories.</p>

<p id="id00989"><i>Civitatibus</i>. Dat. for Gen.—<i>Pro nobis</i>. Abl. with prep. for dat.
Enallage. R.—<i>Conventus. Convention</i>, meeting.</p>

<p id="id00990"><i>Coelum—foedum</i>. The fog and rain of the British Isles are still
proverbial.—<i>Dierum spatia</i>, etc. Cf. Caes. 513.</p>

<p id="id00991"><i>Quod si==and if</i>. From the tendency to connect sentences by relatives
arose the use of <i>quod</i> before certain conjunctions, particularly <i>si</i>,
merely as a copulative. Cf. Z. 807. also Freund sub v. The fact alleged
in this sentence is as false as the philosophy by which it is explained
in the next, cf. G. 45: in ortus, note.</p>

<p id="id00992"><i>Scilicet—cadit</i>. This explanation proceeds on the assumption that night
is caused by the shadow of mountains, behind which the sun sets; and
since these do not exist in that level extremity of the earth, the sun
has nothing to set behind, and so there is no night. The astronomy of T.
is about of a piece with his natural philosophy, cf. 10.—<i>Extrema—
terrarum</i>. Cf. note, 6: <i>inania honoris</i>.</p>

<p id="id00993"><i>Non erigunt</i>, lit. do not elevate the darkness, i.e. do not cast their
shadow so high (<i>infraque—cadit</i>), as the sky and the stars; hence they
are bright (<i>clara</i>) through the night!! Pliny also supposed the heavens
(above the moon) to be of themselves perpetually luminous, but darkened
at night by the shadow of the earth. N.H. 2, 7.</p>

<p id="id00994"><i>Praeter. Beyond</i>. Hence either <i>besides</i> or <i>except</i>. Here the latter.—
<i>Fecundum</i>. More than <i>patiens, fruitful even.—Proveniunt</i>. Ang. <i>come
forward</i>.</p>

<p id="id00995"><i>Fert—aurum</i>, etc. This is also affirmed by Strabo, 4, 5, 2, but denied
by Cic. ad Att., 4, 16, 7, and ad Div., 7, 7. The moderns decide in favor
of T. and Strabo, though it is only in inconsiderable quantities that
gold and silver have ever been found in Britain.</p>

<p id="id00996"><i>Margarita</i>. The neuter form of this word is seldom used, never by
Cicero. See Freund sub v.</p>

<p id="id00997"><i>Rubro mari</i>. The <i>Red Sea</i> of the Greeks and Romans embraced both the
Arabian and the Persian Gulfs; and it was in the latter especially, that
pearls were found, as they are to this day. Cf. Plin. N.H. 9, 54:
praecipue laudantur (margaritae) in <i>Persico sinu maris rubri</i>. For an
explanation of the name (Red Sea), see Anthon's Classical Dictionary.</p>

<p id="id00998"><i>Expulsa sint. Cast out</i>, i.e. <i>ashore, by the waves</i>. Subj. in a

<p id="id01002"><i>Igitur==now</i>. In the first sentence of the section the author has
indicated his purpose to speak of the <i>people</i> of Britain. And <i>now in

meditated an invasion of Brit. and <i>would have invaded it</i>, had he not
been <i>velox ingenio</i>, etc. But in idiomatic Eng. <i>ni</i>==but. Of course
<i>fuisset</i> is to be supplied with <i>velox ingenio</i> and <i>mobilis
poenitentiae</i>. Al. poenitentia. But contrary to the MSS. <i>Mobilis</i> agrees
with <i>poenitentiae</i> (cf. Liv. 31, 32: celerem poenitentiam), which is a
qualifying gen. Gr. 211. R. 6. Lit. <i>of repentance easy to be moved</i>.
Render: <i>fickle of purpose</i>.</p>
