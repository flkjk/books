<p id="id01299"><i>Ambitiosa morte</i>, i.e. morte ultro adita captandae gloriae causa apud
posteros. For. and Fac.</p>

<p id="id01300" style="margin-top: 2em">XLIII. <i>Luctuosus, afflictive</i>, is stronger than <i>tristis, sad</i>.</p>

<p id="id01301"><i>Vulgus</i>. The lower classes, <i>the ignorant and indolent rabble</i>.—
<i>Populus</i>. <i>The common people, tradesmen, mechanics</i>, and the like.
Hence, <i>aliud agens</i>, which implies that they were too busy with
something else of a private nature, to give much attention to public
affairs or the concerns of their neighbors.—<i>Populus</i> and <i>vulgus</i> are
brought together in a similar way, Dial. de Clar. Orat. 7: Vulgus quoque
imperitum et tunicatus hic populus, etc.</p>

<p id="id01302"><i>Nobis—ausim</i>. <i>I should not dare to affirm that we</i> (the friends of A.)
<i>found any conclusive proof</i>, that he was poisoned.—<i>Ceterum</i>. <i>But</i>.
This implies that the circumstantial evidence, which he goes on to
specify, convinced the writer and his friends, as well as the public,
that poison administered by direction of Dom., was really the means of
hastening A. out of the world. Dion Cassius expressly affirms, that he
was poisoned, 66, 20.</p>

<p id="id01303"><i>Principatus</i>. The imperial government in general, i.e. former Emperors.</p>

<p id="id01304"><i>Momenta ipsa deficientis</i>. <i>Each successive stage of his decline</i>.
<i>Ipsa</i> is omitted in the common editions. But it rests on good authority
and it adds to the significance of the clause: <i>the very moments</i>, as it
were, were reported to Dom.</p>

<p id="id01305"><i>Per dispositos cursores</i>. Dom. appears not to have been at Rome at this
time, but in the Alban Villa (cf. 45), or somewhere else.</p>

<p id="id01306"><i>Constabat</i>. That was an <i>admitted point</i>, about which there was entire
<i>agreement</i> (<i>con</i> and <i>sto</i>).</p>

<p id="id01307"><i>Animo vultuque</i>. Hendiadys: <i>he wore in his countenance an expression of
heartfelt grief</i>.</p>

<p id="id01308"><i>Securus odii</i>. Now, that A. was dead, Dom. had nothing to fear in regard
to the <i>object of his hatred</i>, or the <i>gratification of his hate</i>.
<i>Odii</i>. Gen. of the respect.—<i>Qui—dissimularet</i>. <i>Qui==talis, ut</i>,
hence the subj. H. 501, I.; Z. 558.</p>

<p id="id01309"><i>Lecto testamento</i>. When A.'s <i>will was read</i>.</p>

<p id="id01310"><i>Honore judicioque</i>. As if a mark of honor and esteem. E. says==judicio
honorifico.—<i>Piissimae</i>, devoted, affectionate.</p>

<p id="id01311"><i>Malum principem</i>. It was customary for rich men at Rome, who were
anxious to secure any of their property to their heirs, to bequeath a
part of their estates to <i>bad emperors</i> in order to secure the remainder
from their rapacity.</p>

<p id="id01312">This and several preceding sections present a most graphic <i>outline</i> of
the <i>life and times</i> of Dom., the more to be prized, because the full
<i>picture</i>, which T. doubtless drew of him in the Histories, is lost. The
Histories and the Annals are a vast portrait gallery full of such
pictures drawn to the life.</p>

<p id="id01313" style="margin-top: 2em">XLIV. <i>Natus—excessit</i>. The dates assigned for A.'s birth and death, do
not agree with the age ascribed to him. They may be harmonized in either
of two ways, each of which has its advocates: by reading <i>primum</i> instead
of <i>tertium</i>, or, which is perhaps a more probable amendment, since it
only alters the relative position of the two characters, by reading LIV
instead of LVI.</p>

<p id="id01314"><i>Quod si</i>. And if, <i>now if</i>.—<i>Habitum</i>. <i>Personal appearance</i>, cf. G. 5.</p>

<p id="id01315"><i>Decentior quam sublimior</i>. <i>Well proportioned, rather than tall</i>. R.</p>

<p id="id01316"><i>Nihil metus</i>. <i>Nothing to inspire fear in his countenance</i>. Antith. to
<i>gratia—supererat</i>: <i>kindness of expression rather prevailed</i>. So Gr. and
R. For this sense of <i>metus</i>, see note G. 2: ob metum. Död. distinguishes
between <i>vultus</i> and <i>oris</i>, making the former refer more to the <i>eyes</i>
(as if from <i>volvo</i>, the rolling of the eye), to which it belongs to
express anger and fierceness; the latter to the mouth, which is more
expressive of kindness.</p>

<p id="id01317"><i>Medio—aetatis</i>. We should hardly say so of a man dying at 56. But in
Dial. de Clar. Orat. T. speaks of 120 years, as <i>unius hominis aetas</i>.</p>

<p id="id01318"><i>Et vera bona</i>. T. has here in mind the distinction made by philosophers,
particularly the Stoics, between the virtues, which they called the only
real good, and the gifts of fortune, which they declared to be
indifferent.—<i>Et—et, both—and</i>, marks the distinction more strongly.</p>

<p id="id01319"><i>Impleverat</i>. <i>Had enjoyed to the full</i>.</p>

<p id="id01320"><i>Consulari</i>. <i>Having attained to the rank of consul</i> (the summit of a
Roman's ambition) <i>and having been honored with triumphal insignia</i>. Al.
consularibus. But <i>consulari</i> has the better authority and makes the
better sense.</p>

<p id="id01321"><i>Opibus—contigerant</i>. <i>Great riches he did not desire; a respectable
property it was his good fortune to possess</i>, cf. 5: medio rationis atque
abundantiae. Al. non contigerant. But considerable property is implied in
the circumstances attending his will, 43, also in his not asking the
visual salary, 42. Dion Cass. says, however, (66, 20.), that A. spent his
last days in want, as well as in disgrace. For another explanation of
<i>gaudebat</i>, cf. n. G. 6.</p>

<p id="id01322"><i>Quod—ominabatur</i>. <i>Quod</i> is omitted in the common editions. But it is
found in the MSS. And it may be explained on the principle of Zeugma, by
supplying with <i>durare</i> and <i>videre</i> a verb implied in <i>grande solatium
tulit</i> thus: <i>though (sicuti) it would have been a great gratification to
A. to behold the dawn of this auspicious age and see Trajan Emperor, of
which he expressed in my hearing a sort of prophetic anticipation and
desire, yet (ita)</i>, etc. Cassius affirms (69, 12), that by auguries the
elevation of Trajan to the throne was foretold, as early as A.U.C. 844,
i.e. <i>two years before the death of A</i>. The reference to Trajan here, as
in 3, marks clearly the date of the composition, cf. note, 3: augeatque
Trajanus.</p>

<p id="id01323"><i>Spiramenta</i>. <i>Breathing-spells</i>, i.e. intervals to recover and take
breath in. The word is found only in poetry and post-Augustan prose, and,
in the expressive sense in which it is here used, only in Ammian. Marc.
29, 1. See Or. and Freund.</p>

<p id="id01324"><i>Velut uno ictu</i>. The commentators illustrate the force of this
expression by reference to Caligula's wish (Vid. Sen. de Va. 3, 19), that
the Roman people had but one neck, ut scelera sua in <i>unum ictum</i> et unum
diem cogeret.</p>

<p id="id01325" style="margin-top: 2em">XLV. <i>Non vidit</i>. Did not see, as he would have done, had he lived a few
years longer. This passage resembles Cic. de Orat. 3, 2, 8, too closely
to be mere coincidence. Imitator tamen, id quod uni Tacito contigit,
auctore suo praestantior. Rit.</p>

<p id="id01326"><i>Consularium</i>. Rhen. collects from Suet. the names of several victims of
Dom.'s displeasure, <i>who had been consuls</i>.</p>

<p id="id01327"><i>Feminarum</i>. Pliny has preserved the names of several of this list—
Gratilla, wife of Rusticus, Arria, wife of Thrasea, Fannia, daughter of
Thrasea and betrothed to Helvidius. Their husbands will be remembered as
having been mentioned in 1 and 2.</p>

<p id="id01328"><i>Carus Metius</i>. An infamous informer, cf. Plin. Epist. 7, 19; Juv. 1, 35;
Mart. 12, 25, 5.</p>

<p id="id01329"><i>Censebatur</i>. <i>Was honored</i>, ironice. <i>Censeri</i> est aestimari, sive
existimationem consequi. Dr.</p>

<p id="id01330"><i>Una—victoria</i>. He had occasioned the death of but one innocent victim.—
<i>Adhuc</i>. Up to the death of A., cf. G. 38: adhuc, note.</p>

<p id="id01331"><i>Albanam arcem</i>. A favorite retreat of Dom. (situated at the foot of the
Alban Mount, about seventeen miles from Rome), where he sometimes
convened the Senate, and held his court with its troop of informers, cf.
note, 43: cursores. Rit. in loc. suggests, that by the use of <i>arcem</i>
instead of <i>palatium</i>, T. means to represent Domitian as shutting himself
up, like many tyrants, in a fortified castle, and thence sending forth
the emissaries of his jealousy and cruelty.</p>

<p id="id01332"><i>Sententia. His voice</i>, his sentiment expressed in council before Dom.—
<i>Intra Albanam arcem</i>, i.e. <i>privately</i>, not <i>publicly</i>, as afterwards
at Rome.</p>

<p id="id01333"><i>Messalini</i>. Fuit inter principea adulatores et delatores. Dr. cf. Plin.
Epist. 4, 22; Juv. 4, 113, seq.</p>

<p id="id01334"><i>Massa Bebius</i>. Primus inter pares of Domitian's tools. He began his
career under Vesp. cf. His. 4, 50. He was afterwards impeached and
condemned at the instance of the Province of Baetica, Pliny and Senecio
advocates for the impeachment, Plin. Epist 7, 33; 3, 4; 6, 29.—<i>Jam
tum. At that very time</i> on trial, not merely <i>already at that time</i>.
Cf. Hand's Tursel. 3, 113.</p>

<p id="id01335"><i>Nostra</i>, sc. of the Senate, of which T. was a member, though abroad
at the time. Helvidius was arrested <i>in the senate house</i>, cf. Plin.
Ep. 9, 13. This was Helvidius the <i>son</i>, who was put to death by Dom.
(Suet. 10), as his father was by Vesp. (Suet. 15).</p>

<p id="id01336"><i>Visus</i>. Al. divisus. <i>Visus</i>==species, adspectus, Wr.—<i>Perfudit</i>.
Zeugma. Understand in the first clause <i>horrore perfudit</i> (Dr.) or probro
affecit (R.): <i>the spectacle of Mauricus and Rusticus</i> (hurried away, the
one to exile, the other to death), <i>filled us with horror; we were
stained by the innocent blood of Senecio</i>. Of Rusticus and Senecio, see
2, note. Of Mauricus, see Plin. Ep. 4, 22: quo viro nihil firmius, nihil
verius. Also Plin. Ep. 3, 11.</p>

<p id="id01337"><i>Videre</i>, sc. Domitianum.—<i>Aspici</i>, sc. a Domitiano. For difference in
the signification in these words, cf. 40: viso aspectoque, note.</p>

<p id="id01338"><i>Suspiria—subscriberentur. When our sighs</i> (of sympathy with the
condemned) <i>were registered against us</i> (by spies and informers, as a
ground of accusation before the Emperor).</p>

<p id="id01339"><i>Rubor</i>. Redness, referring to the complexion of Dom., which was such as
to conceal a blush, cf. Suet. Dom. 18: vultu ruboris pleno.</p>

<p id="id01340"><i>Opportunitate mortis</i>. An expression of Cic., in the similar passage
above cited (de Orat. 3, 2, 8), touching the death of Crassus.</p>

<p id="id01341"><i>Pro virili portione</i>, lit. for one man's share, referring primarily to
pecuniary assessments. Here: <i>for thy part—so far as thou wast
concerned</i>. A. died with a calmness which would scarcely admit of the
supposition, that he felt himself to be a victim of poison and imperial
jealousy.</p>

<p id="id01342"><i>Filiaque ejus</i>. The apostrophe is here dropped to be resumed at <i>optime
parentum</i>. So the MSS. For they read <i>ejus</i> here, and <i>amissus est</i>
below. Rhenanus omitted <i>ejus</i>, and wrote <i>es</i> for <i>est</i>; and he has been
followed in the common editions since.</p>

<p id="id01343"><i>Conditione</i>. By the circumstance, or by virtue of our long absence. T.
and his wife had parted with A. four years before his death, and had been
absent from Rome ever since, where or why does not appear.</p>

<p id="id01344"><i>Superfuere</i>. Cf. <i>superest</i>, G. 6, note.</p>

<p id="id01345" style="margin-top: 2em">XLVI. <i>Sapientibus</i>. Cf. <i>sapientiae professoribus</i>, 2, note.—<i>Te
immortalibus laudibus</i>. I feel constrained to recur to the reading of
Lipsius and Ritter, it is so much more spirited than <i>quam temporalibus</i>.
<i>Potius</i> manifestly should refer back to <i>lugeri</i> and <i>plangi</i>. The
comparison contained in the more common reading is uncalled for in the
connection, and of little significance in itself. The MSS. read
<i>temporalibus laudibus</i> without <i>quam</i> and this may be more easily
resolved into <i>te immortalibus</i>, than <i>quam</i> can be supplied.—
<i>Similitudine</i>. Al. aemulatione. For such a use of similitudo, cf. Cic.
Tusc. Quaest. 1, 46, 110: quorum (sc. Curii, Fabricii, Scipionum, etc.),
<i>similitudinem</i> aliquam qui arripuerit, etc.</p>

<p id="id01346"><i>Decoremus</i>. Ennius (cited by Cic. Tusc. Q. 1, 49, 117, and de Senect.
20, 73), uses the same word in expressing the same sentiment: nemo me
lacrumis <i>decoret</i> nec funera fletu faxit. Cf. also G. 28.</p>

<p id="id01347"><i>Formam</i>. This makes the sense so much better (than <i>famam</i>), that E. Dr.
Wr. R. and most others have adopted it against the authority of the MSS.
cf. <i>forma mentis</i>, below, and Cic. passim.</p>

<p id="id01348"><i>Intercedendum. To be prohibited</i>. Properly said of a <i>veto interposed</i>
by the Tribunes; then of any prohibition.—<i>Non quia==not that</i>, is
characteristic of late writers. It is followed by the subj. Z. 537, and
note H. 1, 15.</p>

<p id="id01349"><i>Manet, mansurumque est</i>. Cf. Vell. Paterc. 2, 66, 5: vivit, vivetque per
omnem saeculorum memoriam. The periphrastic form (<i>mansurum est</i>) differs
however from the future (<i>manebit</i>), as our <i>is to remain</i> from <i>will
remain</i>. See Z. 498.</p>

<p id="id01350"><i>Oblivio obruet</i>, sc. for want of a historian, carent quia <i>vate sacro</i>,
cf. Hor. Od. 4, 9, 25, seq. By <i>multos veterum</i>, T. means many ancients
of <i>real worth</i>. So <i>velut</i> implies. A. is to be immortalized through his
biographer. This is implied in <i>narratus et traditus</i>. Ancient authors
thought it not improper to express a calm consciousness of merit and a
proud confidence of immortality. T. is very modest and delicate in the
manner of intimating his expectations. But the sentiment of these last
words is substantially the same with the line of Horace: Exegi monumentum
aere perennius. The whole peroration of this Biography is one of singular
beauty and moral elevation. Pathetic, yet calm, rich in noble sentiments
and animated by the purest and loftiest spirit, it is a fit topstone to
that monument, in respect to which T. felt so well founded an assurance,
which still <i>manet mansurumque est in animis hominum, in aeternitate
temporum, fama rerum</i>. There is scarcely an educated youth in Christendom
who is not as familiar with the name of Agricola, as with that of Aeneas
and Ulysses. And the only reason why we know anything of these heroes, is
the genius of their respective biographers. There had been other
Agricolas before the age of Trajan, as there had been other heroes like
Aeneas, and other wandering sages like Ulysses, before the war of Troy.
But they found no Tacitus, Virgil, and Homer to record their adventurous
and virtuous deeds. It is the prerogative of eminent writers to confer
immortality; and though Alexander would prefer to be Achilles rather than
Homer, we should have known little of his achievements, had he not
encouraged scholars as well as warriors, and rewarded genius no less than
valor.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h5 id="id01387">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h5>

<p id="id01388">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p id="id01389">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

<h5 id="id01395">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h5>

<p id="id01396">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p id="id01397">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<p id="id01398">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p id="id01399">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p id="id01400">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h5 id="id01401">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h5>

<p id="id01402">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p id="id01403">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p id="id01404">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p id="id01405">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
