<p>Though outspent with care and unceasing grief, I am withdrawn, Ortalus, from the learned Virgins, nor is my soul's mind able to bring forth sweet babes of the Muses (so much does it waver 'midst ills: for but lately the wave of the Lethean stream doth lave with its flow the pallid foot of my brother, whom 'neath the Rhoetean seaboard the Trojan soil doth crush, thrust from our eyesight. * * * Never again may I salute thee, nor hear thy converse; never again, O brother, more loved than life, may I see thee in aftertime. But for all time in truth will I love thee, always will I sing elegies made gloomy by thy death, such as the Daulian bird pipes 'neath densest shades of foliage, lamenting the lot of slain Itys.) Yet 'midst sorrows so deep, O Ortalus, I send thee these verses re-cast from Battiades, lest thou shouldst credit thy words by <!-- Page 207 --><a id="page207" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[207]"></a>chance have slipt from my mind, given o'er to the wandering winds, as 'twas with that apple, sent as furtive love-token by the wooer, which outleapt from the virgin's chaste bosom; for, placed by the hapless girl 'neath her soft vestment, and forgotten,—when she starts at her mother's approach, out 'tis shaken: and down it rolls headlong to the ground, whilst a tell-tale flush mantles the face of the distressed girl.</p>

<p>He who scanned all the lights of the great firmament, who ascertained the rising and the setting of the stars, how the flaming splendour of the swift sun was endarkened, how the planets disappear at certain seasons, how sweet love with <!-- Page 216 --><a id="page216" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[216]"></a>stealth detaining Trivia beneath the Latmian crags, draws her away from her airy circuit, that same Conon saw me amongst celestial light, the hair from Berenice's head, gleaming with brightness, which she outstretching graceful arms did devote to the whole of the gods, when the king flushed with the season of new wedlock had gone to lay waste the Assyrian borders, bearing the sweet traces of nightly contests, in which he had borne away her virginal spoils. Is Venus abhorred by new-made brides? Why be the parents' joys turned aside by feigned tears, which they shed copiously amid the lights of the nuptial chamber? Untrue are their groans, by the gods I swear! This did my queen teach me by her many lamentings, when her bridegroom set out for stern warfare. Yet thou didst not mourn the widowhood of desolate couch, but the tearful separation from a dear brother? How care made sad inroads in thy very marrow! In so much that thine whole bosom being agitated, and thy senses being snatched from thee, thy mind wandered! But in truth I have known thee great of heart ever since thou wast a little maiden. Hast thou forgotten that noble deed, by which thou didst gain a regal wedlock, than which none dared other deeds bolder? Yet what grieving words didst thou speak when bidding thy bridegroom farewell! Jupiter! as with sad hand often thine eyes thou didst dry! What mighty god changed thee? Was it that lovers are unwilling to be long absent from <!-- Page 217
  --><a id="page217" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[217]"></a>their dear one's body? Then didst thou devote me to the whole of the gods on thy sweet consort's behalf, not without blood of bullocks, should he be granted safe return. In no long time he added captive Asia to the Egyptian boundaries. Wherefore for these reasons I, bestowed 'midst the celestial host, by a new gift fulfil thine ancient promise. With grief, O queen, did I quit thy brow, with grief: I swear to thee and to thine head; fit ill befall whosoever shall swear lightly: but who may bear himself peer with steel? Even that mountain was swept away, the greatest on earth, over which Thia's illustrious progeny passed, when the Medes created a new sea, and the barbarian youth sailed its fleet through the middle of Athos. What can locks of hair do, when such things yield to iron? Jupiter! may the whole race of the Chalybes perish, and whoever first questing the veins 'neath the earth harassed its hardness, breaking it through with iron. Just before severance my sister locks were mourning my fate, when Ethiop Memnon's brother, the winged steed, beating the air with fluttering pennons, appeared before Locrian Arsinoe, and this one bearing me up, flies through aethereal shadows and lays me in the chaste bosom of Venus. Him Zephyritis herself had dispatched as her servant, a Grecian settler on the Canopian shores. For 'twas the wish of many gods that not alone in heaven's light should the golden coronet from Ariadne's temples stay fixed, but that we also should gleam, <!-- Page 218 --><a id="page218" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[218]"></a>the spoils devote from thy golden-yellow head; when humid with weeping I entered the temples of the gods, the Goddess placed me, a new star, amongst the ancient ones. For a-touching the Virgin's and the fierce Lion's gleams, hard by Callisto of Lycaon, I turn westwards fore-guiding the slow-moving Bootes who sinks unwillingly and late into the vasty ocean. But although the footsteps of the gods o'erpress me in the night-tide, and the daytime restoreth me to the white-haired Tethys, (grant me thy grace to speak thus, O Rhamnusian virgin, for I will not hide the truth through any fear, even if the stars revile me with ill words yet I will unfold the pent-up feelings from truthful breast) I am not so much rejoiced at these things as I am tortured by being for ever parted, parted from my lady's head, with whom I (though whilst a virgin she was free from all such cares) drank many a thousand of Syrian scents.</p>
<p>Now do you, whom the gladsome light of the wedding torches hath joined, yield not your bodies to your desiring husbands nor throw aside your vestments and bare your bosom's nipples, before your onyx cup brings me jocund gifts, your onyx, ye who seek the dues of chaste marriage-bed. But she who giveth herself to foul adultery, may the light-lying dust responselessly drink her vile gifts, for I seek no offerings from folk that do ill. But rather, O brides, may concord always be yours, <!-- Page
  219 --><a id="page219" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[219]"></a>and constant love ever dwell in your homes. But when thou, O queen, whilst gazing at the stars, shalt propitiate the goddess Venus with festal torch-lights, let not me, thine own, be left lacking of unguent, but rather gladden me with large gifts. Stars fall in confusion! So that I become a royal tress, Orion might gleam in Aquarius' company.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Catullus</i>.</p>
<p>O dear in thought to the sweet husband, dear in thought to his sire, hail! and may Jove augment his good grace to thee, Door! which of old, men say, didst serve Balbus benignly, whilst the oldster held his home here; and which contrariwise, so 'tis said, didst serve with grudging service after the old man was stretched stark, thou doing service to the bride. Come, tell us why thou art reported to be changed and to have renounced thine ancient faithfulness to thy lord?</p>
<p class="cenhead"><i>Door</i>.</p>
<p>No, (so may I please Caecilius to whom I am now made over!) it is not my fault, although 'tis said so to be, nor may anyone impute any crime to me; albeit the fabling tongues of folk make it so, who, whene'er aught is found not well done, all clamour at me: "Door, thine is the blame!"</p>
<p class="cenhead"><i>Catullus</i>.</p>
<p>It is not enough for thee to say this by words merely, but so to act that everyone may feel it and see it.</p>
<p class="cenhead"><i>Door</i>.</p>
<p>In what way can I? No one questions or troubles to know.</p>
<p><!-- Page 225 --><a id="page225" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[225]"></a></p>
<p class="cenhead"><i>Catullus</i>.</p>
<p>We are wishful: be not doubtful to tell us.</p>
<p class="cenhead"><i>Door</i>.</p>
<p>First then, the virgin (so they called her!) who was handed to us was spurious. Her husband was not the first to touch her, he whose little dagger, hanging more limply than the tender beet, never raised itself to the middle of his tunic: but his father is said to have violated his son's bed and to have polluted the unhappy house, either because his lewd mind blazed with blind lust, or because his impotent son was sprung from sterile seed, and therefore one greater of nerve than he was needed, who could unloose the virgin's zone.</p>
<p class="cenhead"><i>Catullus</i>.</p>
<p>Thou tellest of an excellent parent marvellous in piety, who himself urined in the womb of his son!</p>
<p class="cenhead"><i>Door</i>.</p>
<p>But not this alone is Brixia said to have knowledge of, placed 'neath the Cycnean peak, through which the golden-hued Mella flows with its gentle current, Brixia, beloved mother of my Verona. For it talks of the loves of Postumius and of Cornelius, with whom she committed foul adultery.</p>
<p class="cenhead"><i>Catullus</i>.</p>
<p>Folk might say here: "How knowest thou these things, O door? thou who art never allowed absence from thy lord's threshold, nor mayst hear <!--
  Page 226 --><a id="page226" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[226]"></a>the folk's gossip, but fixed to this beam art wont only to open or to shut the house!"</p>
<p class="cenhead"><i>Door</i>.</p>
<p>Often have I heard her talking with hushed voice, when alone with her handmaids, about her iniquities, quoting by name those whom we have spoken of, for she did not expect me to be gifted with either tongue or ear. Moreover she added a certain one whose name I'm unwilling to speak, lest he uplift his red eyebrows. A lanky fellow, against whom some time ago was brought a grave law-suit anent the spurious child-birth of a lying belly.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">To Manius on Various Matters</span>.</p>
<div class="contents">
<div class="stanza">
<p>When to me sore opprest by bitter chance of misfortune</p>
<p class="i2">This thy letter thou send'st written wi' blotting of tears,</p>
<p>So might I save thee flung by spuming billows of ocean,</p>
<p class="i2">Shipwreckt, rescuing life snatcht from the threshold of death;</p>
<div class="linenum">5</div>
<p>Eke neither Venus the Holy to rest in slumber's refreshment</p>
<p class="i2">Grants thee her grace on couch lying deserted and lone,</p>
<p>Nor can the Muses avail with dulcet song of old writers</p>
<p class="i2">Ever delight thy mind sleepless in anxious care;</p>
<p>Grateful be this to my thought since thus thy friend I'm entitled,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p class="i2">Hence of me seekest thou gifts Muses and Venus can give:</p>
<p>But that bide not unknown to thee my sorrows (O Manius!)</p>
<p class="i2">And lest office of host I should be holden to hate,</p>
<p>Learn how in Fortune's deeps I chance myself to be drownèd,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor fro' the poor rich boons furthermore prithee require.</p>
<div class="linenum">15</div>
<p>What while first to myself the pure-white garment was given,</p>
<!-- Page 233 --><a id="page233" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[233]"></a>
<p class="i2">Whenas my flowery years flowed in fruition of spring,</p>
<p>Much I disported enow, nor 'bode I a stranger to Goddess</p>
<p class="i2">Who with our cares is lief sweetness of bitter to mix:</p>
<p>Yet did a brother's death pursuits like these to my sorrow</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p class="i2">Bid for me cease: Oh, snatcht brother! from wretchedest me.</p>
<p>Then, yea, thou by thy dying hast broke my comfort, O brother;</p>
<p class="i2">Buried together wi' thee lieth the whole of our house;</p>
<p>Perisht along wi' thyself all gauds and joys of our life-tide,</p>
<p class="i2">Douce love fostered by thee during the term of our days.</p>
<div class="linenum">25</div>
<p>After thy doom of death fro' mind I banishèd wholly</p>
<p class="i2">Studies like these, and all lending a solace to soul;</p>
<p>Wherefore as to thy writ:—"Verona's home for Catullus</p>
<p class="i2">Bringeth him shame, for there men of superior mark</p>
<p>Must on a deserted couch fain chafe their refrigerate limbs:"</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p class="i2">Such be no shame (Manius!): rather 'tis matter of ruth.</p>
<!-- Page 234 --><a id="page234" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[234]"></a>
<p>Pardon me, then, wilt thou an gifts bereft me by grieving</p>
<p class="i2">These I send not to thee since I avail not presènt.</p>
<p>For, that I own not here abundant treasure of writings</p>
<p class="i2">Has for its cause, in Rome dwell I; and there am I homed,</p>
<div class="linenum">35</div>
<p>There be my seat, and there my years are gathered to harvest;</p>
<p class="i2">Out of book-cases galore here am I followed by one.</p>
<p>This being thus, nill I thou deem 'tis spirit malignant</p>
<p class="i2">Acts in such wise or mind lacking of liberal mood</p>
<p>That to thy prayer both gifts be not in plenty supplièd:</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p class="i2">Willingly both had I sent, had I the needed supply.</p>
<p>Nor can I (Goddesses!) hide in what things Allius sent me</p>
<p class="i2">Aid, forbear to declare what was the aidance he deigned:</p>
<p>Neither shall fugitive Time from centuries ever oblivious</p>
<p class="i2">Veil in the blinds of night friendship he lavisht on me.</p>
<div class="linenum">45</div>
<p>But will I say unto you what you shall say to the many</p>
<p class="i2">Thousands in turn, and make paper, old crone, to proclaim</p>
<p>      *       *       *       *</p>
<!-- Page 235 --><a id="page235" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[235]"></a>
<p class="i2">And in his death become noted the more and the more,</p>
<p>Nor let spider on high that weaves her delicate webbing</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p class="i2">Practise such labours o'er Allius' obsolete name.</p>
<p>For that ye weet right well what care Amathúsia two-faced</p>
<p class="i2">Gave me, and how she dasht every hope to the ground,</p>
<p>Whenas I burnt so hot as burn Trinacria's rocks or</p>
<p class="i2">Mallia stream that feeds Œtéan Thermopylæ;</p>
<div class="linenum">55</div>
<p>Nor did these saddened eyes to be dimmed by assiduous weeping</p>
<p class="i2">Cease, and my cheeks with showers ever in sadness be wet.</p>
<p>E'en as from aëry heights of mountain springeth a springlet</p>
<p class="i2">Limpidest leaping forth from rocking felted with moss,</p>
<p>Then having headlong rolled the prone-laid valley downpouring,</p>

<p class="i2">Populous region amid wendeth his gradual way,</p>
<p>Sweetest solace of all to the sweltering traveller wayworn,</p>
<p class="i2">Whenas the heavy heat fissures the fiery fields;</p>
<p>Or, as to seamen lost in night of whirlwind a-glooming</p>
<p class="i2">Gentle of breath there comes fairest and favouring breeze,</p>
<div class="linenum">65</div>
<p>Pollux anon being prayed, nor less vows offered to Castor:—</p>
<!-- Page 236 --><a id="page236" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[236]"></a>
<p class="i2">Such was the aidance to us Manius pleased to afford.</p>
<p>He to my narrow domains far wider limits laid open,</p>
<p class="i2">He too gave me the house, also he gave me the dame,</p>
<p>She upon whom both might exert them, partners in love deeds.</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p class="i2">Thither graceful of gait pacing my goddess white-hued</p>
<p>Came and with gleaming foot on the worn sole of the threshold</p>
<p class="i2">Stood she and prest its slab creaking her sandals the while;</p>
<p>E'en so with love enflamed in olden days to her helpmate,</p>
<p class="i2">Laodamía the home Protesiléan besought,</p>
<div class="linenum">75</div>
<p>Sought, but in vain, for ne'er wi' sacrificial bloodshed</p>
<p class="i2">Victims appeasèd the Lords ruling Celestial seats:</p>
<p>Never may I so joy in aught (Rhamnusian Virgin!)</p>
<p class="i2">That I engage in deed maugrè the will of the Lords.</p>
<p>How starved altar can crave for gore in piety pourèd,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p class="i2">Laodamia learnt taught by the loss of her man,</p>
<p>Driven perforce to loose the neck of new-wedded help-mate,</p>
<!-- Page 237 --><a id="page237" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[237]"></a>
<p class="i2">Whenas a winter had gone, nor other winter had come,</p>
<p>Ere in the long dark nights her greeding love was so sated</p>
<p class="i2">That she had power to live maugrè a marriage broke off,</p>
<div class="linenum">85</div>
<p>Which, as the Parcæ knew, too soon was fated to happen</p>
<p class="i2">Should he a soldier sail bound for those Ilian walls.</p>
<p>For that by Helena's rape, the Champion-leaders of Argives</p>
<p class="i2">Unto herself to incite Troy had already begun,</p>
<p>Troy (ah, curst be the name) common tomb of Asia and Europe,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p class="i2">Troy to sad ashes that turned valour and valorous men!</p>
<p>Eke to our brother beloved, destruction ever lamented</p>
<p class="i2">Brought she: O Brother for aye lost unto wretchedmost me,</p>
<p>Oh, to thy wretchedmost brother lost the light of his life-tide,</p>
<p class="i2">Buried together wi' thee lieth the whole of our house:</p>
<div class="linenum">95</div>
<p>Perisht along wi' thyself forthright all joys we enjoyèd,</p>
<p class="i2">Douce joys fed by thy love during the term of our days;</p>
<p>Whom now art tombed so far nor 'mid familiar pavestones</p>
<!-- Page 238 --><a id="page238" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[238]"></a>
<p class="i2">Nor wi' thine ashes stored near to thy kith and thy kin,</p>
<p>But in that Troy obscene, that Troy of ill-omen, entombèd</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p class="i2">Holds thee, an alien earth-buried in uttermost bourne.</p>
<p>Thither in haste so hot ('tis said) from allwhere the Youth-hood</p>

<p>Lest with a stolen punk with fullest of pleasure should Paris</p>
<p class="i2">Fairly at leisure and ease sleep in the pacific bed.</p>
<div class="linenum">105</div>
<p>Such was the hapless chance, most beautiful Laodamia,</p>
<p class="i2">Tare fro' thee dearer than life, dearer than spirit itself,</p>
<p>Him, that husband, whose love in so mighty a whirlpool of passion</p>
<p class="i2">Whelmed thee absorbèd and plunged deep in its gulfy abyss,</p>
<p>E'en as the Grecians tell hard by Phenéus of Cylléne</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p class="i2">Drained was the marish and dried, forming the fattest of soils,</p>
<p>Whenas in days long done to delve through marrow of mountains</p>
<p class="i2">Darèd, falsing his sire, Amphtryóniades;</p>
<p>What time sure of his shafts he smote Stymphalian monsters</p>

<p class="i2">Slaying their host at the hest dealt by a lord of less worth,</p>
<div class="linenum">115</div>
<p>So might the gateway of Heaven be trodden by more of the godheads,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor might Hébé abide longer to maidenhood doomed.</p>
<p>Yet was the depth of thy love far deeper than deepest of marish</p>
<p class="i2">Which the hard mistress's yoke taught him so tamely to bear;</p>
<p>Never was head so dear to a grandsire wasted by life-tide</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p class="i2">Whenas one daughter alone a grandson so tardy had reared,</p>
<p>Who being found against hope to inherit riches of forbears</p>
<p class="i2">In the well-witnessed Will haply by name did appear,</p>
<p>And 'spite impious hopes of baffled claimant to kinship</p>

<p>Nor with such rapture e'er joyed his mate of snowy-hued plumage</p>
<p class="i2">Dove-mate, albeit aye wont in her immoderate heat</p>
<p>Said be the bird to snatch hot kisses with beak ever billing,</p>
<p class="i2">As diddest thou:—yet is Woman multivolent still.</p>
<p>But thou 'vailedest alone all these to conquer in love-lowe,</p>

<p class="i2">When conjoinèd once more unto thy yellow-haired spouse.</p>
<p>Worthy of yielding to her in naught or ever so little</p>

<p><!-- Page 242 --><a id="page242" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[242]"></a></p>
<p>That when, opprest by fortune and in grievous case, thou didst send me this epistle o'erwrit with tears, that I might bear up shipwrecked thee tossed by the foaming waves of the sea, and restore thee from the threshold of death; thou whom neither sacred Venus suffers to repose in soft slumber, desolate on a a lonely couch, nor do the Muses divert with the sweet song of ancient poets, whilst thy anxious mind keeps vigil:—this is grateful to me, since thou dost call me thy friend, and dost seek hither the gifts of the Muses and of Venus. But that my troubles may not be unknown to thee, O Manius, nor thou deem I shun the office of host, hear how I am whelmed in the waves of that same fortune, nor further seek joyful gifts from a wretched one. In that time when the white vestment was first handed to me, and my florid age was passing in jocund spring, much did I sport enow: nor was the goddess unknown to us who mixes bitter-sweet with our cares. But my brother's death plunged all this pursuit into mourning. O brother, taken from my unhappy self; thou by thy dying hast broken my ease, O brother; all our house is buried with thee; with thee have perished the whole of our joys, which thy sweet love nourished in thy lifetime. Thou lost, I have dismissed wholly from mind these studies and every delight of mind. Wherefore, as to what thou writest, "'Tis shameful for Catullus to be at Verona, for there anyone of utmost note must chafe his frigid limbs on a desolate couch;" that, Manius, is not shameful; rather 'tis a <!-- Page 243 --><a id="page243" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[243]"></a>pity. Therefore, do thou forgive, if what grief has snatched from me, these gifts, I do not bestow on thee, because I am unable. For, that there is no great store of writings with me arises from this, that we live at Rome: there is my home, there is my hall, thither my time is passed; hither but one of my book-cases follows me. As 'tis thus, I would not that thou deem we act so from ill-will or from a mind not sufficiently ingenuous, that ample store is not forthcoming to either of thy desires: both would I grant, had I the wherewithal. Nor can I conceal, goddesses, in what way Allius has aided me, or with how many good offices he has assisted me; nor shall fleeting time with its forgetful centuries cover with night's blindness this care of his. But I tell it to you, and do ye declare it to many thousands, and make this paper, grown old, speak of it * * * * And let him be more and more noted when dead, nor let the spider aloft, weaving her thin-drawn web, carry on her work over the neglected name of Allius. For you know what anxiety of mind wily Amathusia gave me, and in what manner she overthrew me, when I was burning like the Trinacrian rocks, or the Malian fount in Oetaean Thermopylae; nor did my piteous eyes cease to dissolve with continual weeping, nor my cheeks with sad showers to be bedewed. As the pellucid stream gushes forth from the moss-grown rock on the aerial crest of the mountain, which when it has rolled headlong prone down the valley, softly wends its way through the midst of the <!-- Page
  244 --><a id="page244" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[244]"></a>populous parts, sweet solace to the wayfarer sweating with weariness, when the oppressive heat cracks the burnt-up fields agape: or, as to sailors tempest-tossed in black whirlpool, there cometh a favourable and a gently-moving breeze, Pollux having been prayed anon, and Castor alike implored: of such kind was Manius' help to us. He with a wider limit laid open my closed field; he gave us a home and its mistress, on whom we both might exercise our loves in common. Thither with gracious gait my bright-hued goddess betook herself, and pressed her shining sole on the worn threshold with creaking of sandal; as once came Laodamia, flaming with love for her consort, to the home of Protesilaus,—a beginning of naught! for not yet with sacred blood had a victim made propitiate the lords of the heavens. May nothing please me so greatly, Rhamnusian virgin, that I should act thus heedlessly against the will of those lords! How the thirsty altar craves for sacrificial blood Laodamia was taught by the loss of her husband, being compelled to abandon the neck of her new spouse when one winter was past, before another winter had come, in whose long nights she might so glut her greedy love, that she could have lived despite her broken marriage-yoke, which the Parcae knew would not be long distant, if her husband as soldier should fare to the Ilian walls. For by Helena's rape Troy had begun to put the Argive Chiefs in the field; Troy accurst, the common grave of Asia and <!-- Page 245
  --><a id="page245" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[245]"></a>of Europe, Troy, the sad ashes of heroes and of every noble deed, that also lamentably brought death to our brother. O brother taken from unhappy me! O jocund light taken from thy unhappy brother! in thy one grave lies all our house, in thy one grave have perished all our joys, which thy sweet love did nurture during life. Whom now is laid so far away, not amongst familiar tombs nor near the ashes of his kindred, but obscene Troy, malign Troy, an alien earth, holds thee entombed in its remote soil. Thither, 'tis said, hastening together from all parts, the Grecian manhood forsook their hearths and homes, lest Paris enjoy his abducted trollop with freedom and leisure in a peaceful bed. Such then was thy case, loveliest Laodamia, to be bereft of husband sweeter than life, and than soul; thou being sucked in so great a whirlpool of love, its eddy submerged thee in its steep abyss, like (so folk say) to the Graian gulph near Pheneus of Cyllene with its fat swamp's soil drained and dried, which aforetime the falsely-born Amphitryoniades dared to hew through the marrow of cleft mountains, at the time when he smote down the Stymphalian monsters with sure shafts by the command of his inferior lord, so that the heavenly portal might be pressed by a greater number of deities, nor Hebe longer remain in her virginity. But deeper than that abyss was thy deep love which taught [thy husband] to bear his lady's forceful yoke. For not so dear to the spent age of the grandsire is the late born <!--
  Page 246 --><a id="page246" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[246]"></a>grandchild an only daughter rears, who, long-wished-for, at length inherits the ancestral wealth, his name duly set down in the attested tablets; and casting afar the impious hopes of the baffled next-of-kin, scares away the vulture from the whitened head; nor so much does any dove-mate rejoice in her snow-white consort (though, 'tis averred, more shameless than most in continually plucking kisses with nibbling beak) as thou dost, though woman is especially inconstant. But thou alone didst surpass the great frenzies of these, when thou wast once united to thy yellow-haired husband. Worthy to yield to whom in naught or in little, my light brought herself to my bosom, round whom Cupid, often running hither thither, gleamed lustrous-white in saffron-tinted tunic. Still although she is not content with Catullus alone, we will suffer the rare frailties of our coy lady, lest we may be too greatly unbearable, after the manner of fools. Often even Juno, greatest of heaven-dwellers, boiled with flaring wrath at her husband's default, wotting the host of frailties of all-wishful Jove. Yet 'tis not meet to match men with the gods, * * * * bear up the ungrateful burden of a tremulous parent. Yet she was not handed to me by a father's right hand when she came to my house fragrant with Assyrian odour, but she gave me her stealthy favours in the mute night, withdrawing of her own will from the bosom of her spouse. Wherefore that is enough if to us alone she gives that day which she <!-- Page 247 --><a id="page247" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[247]"></a>marks with a whiter stone. This gift to thee, all that I can, of verse completed, is requital, Allius, for many offices, so that this day and that, and other and other of days may not tarnish your name with scabrous rust. Hither may the gods add gifts full many, which Themis aforetimes was wont to bear to the pious of old. May ye be happy, both thou and thy life's-love together, and thy home in which we have sported, and its mistress, and Anser who in the beginning brought thee to us, from whom all my good fortunes were first born, and lastly she whose very self is dearer to me than all these,—my light, whom living, 'tis sweet to me to live.</p>
