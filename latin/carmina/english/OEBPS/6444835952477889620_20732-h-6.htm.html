<p>Pine-trees gendered whilòme upon soaring Peliac summit</p>
<p>Swam (as the tale is told) through liquid surges of Neptune</p>
<p>Far as the Phasis-flood and frontier-land Æëtéan;</p>
<p>Whenas the youths elect, of Argive vigour the oak-heart,</p>
<div class="linenum">5</div>
<p>Longing the Golden Fleece of the Colchis-region to harry,</p>
<p>Dared in a poop swift-paced to span salt seas and their shallows,</p>
<p>Sweeping the deep blue seas with sweeps a-carven of fir-wood.</p>
<!-- Page 163 --><a id="page163" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[163]"></a>
<p>She, that governing Goddess of citadels crowning the cities,</p>
<p>Builded herself their car fast-flitting with lightest of breezes,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>Weaving plants of the pine conjoined in curve of the kelson;</p>
<p>Foremost of all to imbue rude Amphitrité with ship-lore.</p>
<p>Soon as her beak had burst through wind-rackt spaces of ocean,</p>
<p>While th'oar-tortured wave with spumy whiteness was blanching,</p>
<p>Surged from the deep abyss and hoar-capped billows the faces</p>
<div class="linenum">15</div>
<p>Seaborn, Nereids eyeing the prodigy wonder-smitten.</p>
<p>There too mortal orbs through softened spendours regarded</p>
<p>Ocean-nymphs who exposed bodies denuded of raiment</p>
<p>Bare to the breast upthrust from hoar froth capping the sea-depths.</p>
<p>Then Thetis Péleus fired (men say) a-sudden with love-lowe,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Then Thetis nowise spurned to mate and marry wi' mortal,</p>
<p>Then Thetis' Sire himself her yoke with Peleus sanctioned.</p>
<p>Oh, in those happier days now fondly yearned-for, ye heroes</p>
<p>Born; (all hail!) of the Gods begotten, and excellent issue</p>
<!-- Page 164 --><a id="page164" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[164]"></a>
<p>Bred by your mothers, all hail! and placid deal me your favour.</p>
<p>Oft wi' the sound of me, in strains and spells I'll invoke you;</p>
<div class="linenum">25</div>
<p>Thee too by wedding-torch so happily, highly augmented,</p>
<p>Peleus, Thessaly's ward, whomunto Jupiter's self deigned</p>
<p>Yield of the freest gree his loves though gotten of Godheads.</p>
<p>Thee Thetis, fairest of maids Nereian, vouchsafed to marry?</p>
<p>Thee did Tethys empower to woo and wed with her grandchild;</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>Nor less Oceanus, with water compassing th' Earth-globe?</p>
<p>But when ended the term, and wisht-for light of the day-tide</p>
<p>Uprose, flocks to the house in concourse mighty convenèd,</p>
<p>Thessaly all, with glad assembly the Palace fulfilling:</p>
<p>Presents afore they bring, and joy in faces declare they.</p>
<div class="linenum">35</div>
<p>Scyros desert abides: they quit Phthiotican Tempe,</p>
<p>Homesteads of Crannon-town, eke bulwarkt walls of Larissa;</p>
<p>Meeting at Pharsálus, and roof Pharsálian seeking.</p>
<p>None will the fields now till; soft wax all necks of the oxen,</p>
<!-- Page 165 --><a id="page165" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[165]"></a>
<p>Never the humble vine is purged by curve of the rake-tooth,</p>

<p>Never a pruner's hook thins out the shade of the tree-tufts,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Never a bull up-plows broad glebe with bend of the coulter,</p>
<p>Over whose point unuse displays the squalor of rust-stain.</p>
<p>But in the homestead's heart, where'er that opulent palace</p>
<p>Hides a retreat, all shines with splendour of gold and of silver.</p>
<div class="linenum">45</div>
<p>Ivory blanches the seats, bright gleam the flagons a-table,</p>
<p>All of the mansion joys in royal riches and grandeur.</p>
<p>But for the Diva's use bestrewn is the genial bedstead,</p>
<p>Hidden in midmost stead, and its polisht framework of Indian</p>
<p>Tusk underlies its cloth empurpled by juice of the dye-shell.</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p class="i2">This be a figured cloth with forms of manhood primeval</p>

<p>Nor can her sense as yet believe she 'spies the espied,</p>
<!-- Page 166 --><a id="page166" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[166]"></a>
<p>When like one that awakes new roused from slumber deceptive,</p>
<p>Sees she her hapless self lone left on loneliest sandbank:</p>
<p>While as the mindless youth with oars disturbeth the shallows,</p>
<p>Casts to the windy storms what vows he vainly had vowèd.</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Him through the sedges afar the sad-eyed maiden of Minos,</p>
<p>Likest a Bacchant-girl stone-carven, (O her sorrow!)</p>
<p>'Spies, a-tossing the while on sorest billows of love-care.</p>
<p>Now no more on her blood-hued hair fine fillets retains she,</p>
<p>No more now light veil conceals her bosom erst hidden,</p>
<div class="linenum">65</div>
<p>Now no more smooth zone contains her milky-hued paplets:</p>
<p>All gear dropping adown from every part of her person</p>
<p>Thrown, lie fronting her feet to the briny wavelets a sea-toy.</p>
<p>But at such now no more of her veil or her fillet a-floating</p>
<p>Had she regard: on thee, O Theseus! all of her heart-strength,</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>All of her sprite, her mind, forlorn, were evermore hanging.</p>
<p>Ah, sad soul, by grief and grievance driven beside thee,</p>
<!-- Page 167 --><a id="page167" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[167]"></a>
<p>Sowed Erycína first those brambly cares in thy bosom,</p>
<p>What while issuing fierce with will enstarkenèd, Theseus</p>
<p>Forth from the bow-bent shore Piræan putting a-seawards</p>
<div class="linenum">75</div>
<p>Reacht the Gortynian roofs where dwelt th' injurious Monarch.</p>
<p>For 'twas told of yore how forced by pestilence cruel,</p>
<p>Eke as a blood rite due for th' Androgéonian murthur,</p>
<p>Many a chosen youth and the bloom of damsels unmarried</p>
<p>Food for the Minotaur, Cecropia was wont to befurnish.</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>Seeing his narrow walls in such wise vexed with evils,</p>
<p>Theseus of freest will for dear-loved Athens his body</p>
<p>Offered a victim so that no more to Crete be deported</p>
<p>Lives by Cecropia doomed to burials burying nowise;</p>
<p>Then with a swifty ship and soft breathed breezes a-stirring,</p>
<div class="linenum">85</div>
<p>Sought he Minos the Haughty where homed in proudest of Mansions.</p>
<p>Him as with yearning glance forthright espièd the royal</p>
<p>Maiden, whom pure chaste couch aspiring delicate odours</p>
<p>Cherisht, in soft embrace of a mother comforted all-whiles,</p>
<p>(E'en as the myrtles begot by the flowing floods of Eurotas,</p>

<p>Or as the tincts distinct brought forth by breath of the springtide)</p>
<p>Never the burning lights of her eyes from gazing upon him</p>
<p>Turned she, before fierce flame in all her body conceived she</p>
<p>Down in its deepest depths and burning amiddle her marrow.</p>
<p>Ah, with unmitigate heart exciting wretchedmost furies,</p>
<div class="linenum">95</div>
<p>Thou, Boy sacrosanct! man's grief and gladness commingling,</p>
<p>Thou too of Golgos Queen and Lady of leafy Idalium,</p>
<p>Whelm'd ye in what manner waves that maiden phantasy-firèd,</p>
<p>All for a blond-haired youth suspiring many a singulf!</p>
<p>Whiles how dire was the dread she dreed in languishing heart-strings;</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>How yet more, ever more, with golden splendour she palèd!</p>
<p>Whenas yearning to mate his might wi' the furious monster</p>
<p>Theseus braved his death or sought the prizes of praises.</p>
<p>Then of her gifts to gods not ingrate, nor profiting naught,</p>
<p>Promise with silent lip, addressed she timidly vowing.</p>
<div class="linenum">105</div>
<p>For as an oak that shakes on topmost summit of Taurus</p>
<!-- Page 169 --><a id="page169" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[169]"></a>
<p>Its boughs, or cone-growing pine from bole bark resin exuding,</p>
<p>Whirlwind of passing might that twists the stems with its storm-blasts,</p>
<p>Uproots, deracinates, forthright its trunk to the farthest,</p>
<p>Prone falls, shattering wide what lies in line of its downfall,—</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Thus was that wildling flung by Theseus and vanquisht of body,</p>
<p>Vainly tossing its horns and goring the wind to no purpose.</p>
<p>Thence with abounding praise returned he, guiding his footsteps,</p>
<p>Whiles did a fine drawn thread check steps in wander abounding,</p>
<p>Lest when issuing forth of the winding maze labyrinthine</p>
<div class="linenum">115</div>
<p>Baffled become his track by inobservable error.</p>
<p>But for what cause should I, from early subject digressing,</p>
<p>Tell of the daughter who the face of her sire unseeing,</p>
<p>Eke her sister's embrace nor less her mother's endearments,</p>
<p>Who in despair bewept her hapless child that so gladly</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Chose before every and each the lively wooing of Theseus?</p>
<p>Or how borne by the ship to the yeasting shore-line of Dia</p>
<!-- Page 170 --><a id="page170" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[170]"></a>
<p>Came she? or how when bound her eyes in bondage of slumber</p>
<p>Left her that chosen mate with mind unmindful departing?</p>
<p>Often (they tell) with heart inflamed by fiery fury</p>
<div class="linenum">125</div>
<p>Poured she shrilling of shrieks from deepest depths of her bosom;</p>
<p>Now she would sadly scale the broken faces of mountains,</p>
<p>Whence she might overglance the boundless boiling of billows,</p>
<p>Then she would rush to bestem the salt-plain's quivering wavelet</p>
<p>And from her ankles bare the dainty garment uplifting,</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>Spake she these words ('tis said) from sorrow's deepest abysses,</p>
<p>Whiles from her tear-drencht face outburst cold shivering singulfs.</p>
<p class="i2">"Thus fro' my patrial shore, O traitor, hurried to exile,</p>
<p>Me on a lonely strand hast left, perfidious Theseus?</p>
<p>Thus wise farest, despite the godhead of Deities spurned,</p>
<div class="linenum">135</div>
<p>(Reckless, alas!) to thy home convoying perjury-curses?</p>
<p>Naught, then, ever availed that mind of cruelest counsel</p>
<p>Alter? No saving grace in thee was evermore ready,</p>
<p>That to have pity on me vouchsafed thy pitiless bosom?</p>
<!-- Page 171 --><a id="page171" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[171]"></a>
<p>Natheless not in past time such were the promises wordy</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Lavishèd; nor such hopes to me the hapless were bidden;</p>
<p>But the glad married joys, the longed-for pleasures of wedlock.</p>
<p>All now empty and vain, by breath of the breezes bescattered!</p>
<p>Now, let woman no more trust her to man when he sweareth,</p>
<p>Ne'er let her hope to find or truth or faith in his pleadings,</p>
<div class="linenum">145</div>
<p>Who whenas lustful thought forelooks to somewhat attaining,</p>
<p>Never an oath they fear, shall spare no promise to promise.</p>
<p>Yet no sooner they sate all lewdness and lecherous fancy,</p>
<p>Nothing remember of words and reck they naught of fore-swearing.</p>
<p>Certès, thee did I snatch from midmost whirlpool of ruin</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Deadly, and held it cheap loss of a brother to suffer</p>
<p>Rather than fail thy need (O false!) at hour the supremest.</p>
<p>Therefor my limbs are doomed to be torn of birds, and of ferals</p>
<p>Prey, nor shall upheapt Earth afford a grave to my body.</p>
<!-- Page 172 --><a id="page172" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[172]"></a>
<p>Say me, what lioness bare thee 'neath lone rock of the desert?</p>
<div class="linenum">155</div>
<p>What sea spued thee conceived from out the spume of his surges!</p>
<p>What manner Syrt, what ravening Scylla, what vasty Charybdis?</p>
<p>Thou who for sweet life saved such meeds art lief of returning!</p>
<p>If never willed thy breast with me to mate thee in marriage,</p>
<p>Hating the savage law decreed by primitive parent,</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>Still of your competence 'twas within your household to home me,</p>
<p>Where I might serve as slave in gladsome service familiar,</p>
<p>Laving thy snow-white feet in clearest chrystalline waters</p>
<p>Or with its purpling gear thy couch in company strewing.</p>
<p>Yet for what cause should I 'plain in vain to the winds that unknow me,</p>
<div class="linenum">165</div>
<p>(I so beside me with grief!) which ne'er of senses enduèd</p>
<p>Hear not the words sent forth nor aught avail they to answer?</p>
<p>Now be his course well-nigh engaged in midway of ocean,</p>
<p>Nor any mortal shape appears in barrens of seawrack.</p>
<p>Thus at the latest hour with insults over-sufficient</p>
<!-- Page 173 --><a id="page173" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[173]"></a>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>E'en to my plaints fere Fate begrudges ears that would hear me.</p>
<p>Jupiter! Lord of All-might, Oh would in days that are bygone</p>
<p>Ne'er had Cecropian poops toucht ground at Gnossian foreshore,</p>
<p>Nor to th' unconquered Bull that tribute direful conveying</p>
<p>Had the false Seaman bound to Cretan island his hawser,</p>
<div class="linenum">175</div>
<p>Nor had yon evil wight, 'neath shape the softest hard purpose</p>
<p>Hiding, enjoyed repose within our mansion beguested!</p>
<p>Whither can wend I now? What hope lends help to the lost one?</p>
<p>Idomenéan mounts shall I scale? Ah, parted by whirlpools</p>
<p>Widest, yon truculent main where yields it power of passage?</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>Aid of my sire can I crave? Whom I willing abandoned,</p>
<p>Treading in tracks of a youth bewrayed with blood of a brother!</p>
<p>Can I console my soul wi' the helpful love of a helpmate</p>
<p>Who flies me with pliant oars, flies overbounding the sea-depths?</p>
<p>Nay, an this Coast I quit, this lone isle lends me no roof-tree,</p>
<!-- Page 174 --><a id="page174" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[174]"></a>
<div class="linenum">185</div>
<p>Nor aught issue allows begirt by billows of Ocean:</p>
<p>Nowhere is path for flight: none hope shows: all things are silent:</p>
<p>All be a desolate waste: all makes display of destruction.</p>
<p>Yet never close these eyne in latest languor of dying,</p>
<p>Ne'er from my wearied frame go forth slow-ebbing my senses,</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Ere from the Gods just doom implore I, treason-betrayed,</p>
<p>And with my breath supreme firm faith of Celestials invoke I.</p>
<p>Therefore, O ye who 'venge man's deed with penalties direful,</p>
<p>Eumenides! aye wont to bind with viperous hair-locks</p>
<p>Foreheads,—Oh, deign outspeak fierce wrath from bosom outbreathing,</p>
<div class="linenum">195</div>
<p>Hither, Oh hither, speed, and lend ye all ear to my grievance,</p>
<p>Which now sad I (alas!) outpour from innermost vitals</p>
<p>Maugre my will, sans help, blind, fired with furious madness.</p>
<p>And, as indeed all spring from veriest core of my bosom,</p>
<p>Suffer ye not the cause of grief and woe to evanish;</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>But wi' the Will wherewith could Theseus leave me in loneness,</p>
<!-- Page 175 --><a id="page175" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[175]"></a>
<p>Goddesses! bid that Will lead him, lead his, to destruction."</p>
<p class="i2">E'en as she thus poured forth these words from anguish of bosom,</p>
<p>And for this cruel deed, distracted, sued she for vengeance,</p>
<p>Nodded the Ruler of Gods Celestial, matchless of All-might,</p>
<div class="linenum">205</div>
<p>When at the gest earth-plain and horrid spaces of ocean</p>
<p>Trembled, and every sphere rockt stars and planets resplendent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Theseus himself, obscured in blindness of darkness</p>
<p>As to his mind, dismiss'd from breast oblivious all things</p>
<p>Erewhile enjoined and held hereto in memory constant,</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>Nor for his saddened sire the gladness-signals uphoisting</p>
<p>Heralded safe return within sight of the Erechthean harbour.</p>
<p>For 'twas told of yore, when from walls of the Virginal Deëss</p>
<p>Ægeus speeding his son, to the care of breezes committed,</p>
<p>Thus with a last embrace to the youth spake words of commandment:</p>
<div class="linenum">215</div>
<p class="i2">"Son! far nearer my heart (sole thou) than life of the longest,</p>
<!-- Page 176 --><a id="page176" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[176]"></a>
<p>Son, I perforce dismiss to doubtful, dangerous chances,</p>
<p>Lately restored to me when eld draws nearest his ending,</p>
<p>Sithence such fortune in me, and in thee such boiling of valour</p>
<p>Tear thee away from me so loath, whose eyne in their languor</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>Never are sated with sight of my son, all-dearest of figures.</p>
<p>Nor will I send thee forth with joy that gladdens my bosom,</p>
<p>Nor will I suffer thee show boon signs of favouring Fortune,</p>
<p>But fro' my soul I'll first express an issue of sorrow,</p>
<p>Soiling my hoary hairs with dust and ashes commingled;</p>
<div class="linenum">225</div>
<p>Then will I hang stained sails fast-made to the wavering yard-arms,</p>
<p>So shall our mourning thought and burning torture of spirit</p>
<p>Show by the dark sombre-dye of Iberian canvas spread.</p>
<p>But, an grant me the grace Who dwells in Sacred Itone,</p>
<p>(And our issue to guard and ward the seats of Erechtheus</p>

<!-- Page 177 --><a id="page177" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[177]"></a>
<p>Then do thou so-wise act, and storèd in memory's heart-core</p>
<p>Dwell these mandates of me, no time their traces untracing.</p>
<p>Dip, when first shall arise our hills to gladden thy eye-glance,</p>
<p>Down from thine every mast th'ill-omened vestments of mourning,</p>
<div class="linenum">235</div>
<p>Then let the twisten ropes upheave the whitest of canvas,</p>
<div class="linenum">235<i>b</i></div>
<p>Wherewith splendid shall gleam the tallest spars of the top-mast,</p>
<p>These seeing sans delay with joy exalting my spirit</p>
<p>Well shall I wot boon Time sets thee returning before me."</p>
<p class="i2">Such were the mandates which stored at first in memory constant</p>
<p>Faded from Theseus' mind like mists, compelled by the whirlwind,</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>Fleet from äerial crests of mountains hoary with snow-drifts.</p>
<p>But as the sire had sought the citadel's summit for outlook,</p>
<p>Wasting his anxious eyes with tear-floods evermore flowing,</p>
<p>Forthright e'en as he saw the sail-gear darkened with dye-stain,</p>
<p>Headlong himself flung he from the sea-cliff's pinnacled summit</p>
<div class="linenum">245</div>
<p>Holding his Theseus lost by doom of pitiless Fortune.</p>

<p>Pines aforetimes sprung from Pelion peak floated, so 'tis said, through liquid billows of Neptune to the flowing Phasis and the confines Aeetaean, when the picked youth, the vigour of Argive manhood seeking to carry away the Golden Fleece from Colchis, dared to skim o'er salt seas in a swift-sailing ship, sweeping caerulean ocean with paddles shapen from fir-wood. That Goddess who guards the castles in topmost parts of the towns herself fashioned the car, scudding with lightest of winds, uniting the interweaved pines unto the curving keel. That same first instructed untaught Amphitrite with sailing. Scarce had it split with its stem the windy waves, and the billow vext with oars had whitened into foam, when arose from the abyss of the hoary eddies the faces of sea-dwelling Nereids wondering at the marvel. And then on that propitious day mortal eyes gazed on sea-nymphs with naked bodies bare to the breasts outstanding from the foamy abyss. Then 'tis said Peleus burned with desire for Thetis, then Thetis contemned not mortal hymenaeals, then Thetis' sire himself sanctioned her joining to Peleus. O born in the time of joyfuller ages, heroes, hail! sprung from the gods, good progeny of mothers, hail! and favourably be ye inclined. You oft in my song I'll address, thee too I'll approach, Peleus, pillar of Thessaly, so increased in importance by thy fortunate wedding-torches, to whom Jupiter himself, the sire of the gods himself, yielded up his beloved. Did not Thetis embrace thee, she most <!-- Page 190 --><a id="page190" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[190]"></a>winsome of Nereids born? Did not Tethys consent that thou should'st lead home her grandchild, and Oceanus eke, whose waters girdle the total globe? When in full course of time the longed-for day had dawned, all Thessaly assembled throngs his home, a gladsome company o'erspreading the halls: they bear gifts to the fore, and their joy in their faces they shew. Scyros desert remains, they leave Phthiotic Tempe, Crannon's homes, and the fortressed walls of Larissa; to Pharsalia they hie, 'neath Pharsalian roofs they gather. None tills the soil, the heifers' necks grow softened, the trailing vine is not cleansed by the curved rake-prongs, nor does the sickle prune the shade of the spreading tree-branches, nor does the bullock up-tear the glebe with the prone-bending ploughshare; squalid rust steals o'er the neglected ploughs.</p>
<p>But this mansion, throughout its innermost recesses of opulent royalty, glitters with gleaming gold and with silver. Ivory makes white the seats; goblets glint on the boards; the whole house delights in the splendour of royal treasure. Placed in the midst of the mansion is the bridal bed of the goddess, made glossy with Indian tusks and covered with purple, tinted with the shell-fish's rosy dye. This tapestry embroidered with figures of men of ancient time pourtrays with admirable art the heroes' valour. For looking forth from Dia's beach, resounding with crashing of breakers, Theseus hasting from sight with swiftest of fleets, Ariadne watches, her heart <!-- Page 191 --><a id="page191" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[191]"></a>swelling with raging passion, nor scarce yet credits she sees what she sees, as, newly-awakened from her deceptive sleep, she perceives herself, deserted and woeful, on the lonely shore. But the heedless youth, flying away, beats the waves with his oars, leaving his perjured vows to the gusty gales. In the dim distance from amidst the sea-weed, the daughter of Minos with sorrowful eyes, like a stone-carved Bacchante, gazes afar, alas! gazes after him, heaving with great waves of grief. No longer does the fragile fillet bind her yellow locks, no more with light veil is her hidden bosom covered, no more with rounded zone the milky breasts are clasped; down fallen from her body everything is scattered, hither, thither, and the salt waves toy with them in front of her very feet. But neither on fillet nor floating veil, but on thee, Theseus, in their stead, was she musing: on thee she bent her heart, her thoughts, her love-lorn mind. Ah, woeful one, with sorrows unending distraught, Erycina sows thorny cares deep in thy bosom, since that time when Theseus fierce in his vigour set out from the curved bay of Piraeus, and gained the Gortynian roofs of the iniquitous ruler.</p>
<p>For of old 'tis narrated, that constrained by plague of the cruelest to expiate the slaughter of Androgeos, both chosen youths and the pick of the unmarried maidens Cecropia was wont to give as a feast to the Minotaur. When thus his strait walls with ills were vexed, Theseus with free will preferred to yield up his body for adored Athens rather than <!-- Page 192 --><a id="page192" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[192]"></a>such Cecropian corpses be carried to Crete unobsequied. And therefore borne in a speedy craft by favouring breezes, he came to the imperious Minos and his superb seat. Instant the royal virgin him saw with longing glance, she whom the chaste couch out-breathing sweetest of scents cradled in her mother's tender enfoldings, like to the myrtle which the rivers of Eurotas produce, or the many-tinted blooms opening with the springtide's breezes, she bent not down away from him her kindling glance, until the flame spread through her whole body, and burned into her innermost marrow. Ah, hard of heart, urging with misery to madness, O holy boy, who mingles men's cares and their joyings, and thou queen of Golgos and of foliaged Idalium, on what waves did you heave the mind-kindled maid, sighing full oft for the golden-haired guest! What dreads she bore in her swooning soul! How often did she grow sallower in sheen than gold! When craving to contend against the savage monster Theseus faced death or the palm of praise. Then gifts to the gods not unmeet not idly given, with promise from tight-closed lips did she address her vows. For as an oak waving its boughs on Taurus' top, or a coniferous pine with sweating stem, is uprooted by savage storm, twisting its trunk with its blast (dragged from its roots prone it falleth afar, breaking all in the line of its fall) so did Theseus fling down the conquered body of the brute, tossing its horns in vain towards the skies. Thence <!-- Page 193 --><a id="page193" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[193]"></a>backwards he retraced his steps 'midst great laud, guiding his errant footsteps by means of a tenuous thread, lest when outcoming from tortuous labyrinthines his efforts be frustrated by unobservant wandering. But why, turned aside from my first story, should I recount more, how the daughter fleeing her father's face, her sister's embrace, and e'en her mother's, who despairingly bemoaned her lost daughter, preferred to all these the sweet love of Theseus; or how borne by their boat to the spumy shores of Dia she came; or how her yokeman with unmemoried breast forsaking her, left her bound in the shadows of sleep? And oft, so 'tis said, with her heart burning with fury she outpoured clarion cries from depths of her bosom, then sadly scaled the rugged mounts, whence she could cast her glance o'er the vasty seething ocean, then ran into the opposing billows of the heaving sea, raising from her bared legs her clinging raiment, and in uttermost plight of woe with tear-stained face and chilly sobs spake she thus:—</p>
<p>"Is it thus, O perfidious, when dragged from my motherland's shores, is it thus, O false Theseus, that thou leavest me on this desolate strand? thus dost depart unmindful of slighted godheads, bearing home thy perjured vows? Was no thought able to bend the intent of thy ruthless mind? hadst thou no clemency there, that thy pitiless bowels might compassionate me? But these were not the promises thou gavest me idly of old, this was not what thou didst bid me hope for, but the blithe bride-bed, <!-- Page 194 --><a id="page194" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[194]"></a>hymenaeal happiness: all empty air, blown away by the breezes. Now, now, let no woman give credence to man's oath, let none hope for faithful vows from mankind; for whilst their eager desire strives for its end, nothing fear they to swear, nothing of promises stint they: but instant their lusting thoughts are satiate with lewdness, nothing of speech they remember, nothing of perjuries reck. In truth I snatched thee from the midst of the whirlpool of death, preferring to suffer the loss of a brother rather than fail thy need in the supreme hour, O ingrate. For the which I shall be a gift as prey to be rent by wild beasts and the carrion-fowl, nor dead shall I be placed in the earth, covered with funeral mound. What lioness bare thee 'neath lonely crag? What sea conceived and spued thee from its foamy crest? What Syrtis, what grasping Scylla, what vast Charybdis? O thou repayer with such guerdon for thy sweet life! If 'twas not thy heart's wish to yoke with me, through holding in horror the dread decrees of my stern sire, yet thou couldst have led me to thy home, where as thine handmaid I might have served thee with cheerful service, laving thy snowy feet with clear water, or spreading the purple coverlet o'er thy couch. Yet why, distraught with woe, do I vainly lament to the unknowing winds, which unfurnished with sense, can neither hear uttered complaints nor can return them? For now he has sped away into the midst of the seas, nor doth any mortal appear along this desolate seaboard. Thus with o'erweening <!-- Page 195 --><a id="page195" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[195]"></a>scorn doth bitter Fate in my extreme hour even grudge ears to my plaints. All-powerful Jupiter! would that in old time the Cecropian poops had not touched at the Gnossian shores, nor that bearing to the unquelled bull the direful ransom had the false mariner moored his hawser to Crete, nor that yon wretch hiding ruthless designs beneath sweet seemings had reposed as a guest in our halls! For whither may I flee? in what hope, O lost one, take refuge? Shall I climb the Idomenean crags? but the truculent sea stretching amain with its whirlings of waters separates us. Can I quest help from my father, whom I deserted to follow a youth besprinkled with my brother's blood? Can I crave comfort from the care of a faithful yokeman, who is fleeing with yielding oars, encurving 'midst whirling waters. If I turn from the beach there is no roof in this tenantless island, no way sheweth a passage, circled by waves of the sea; no way of flight, no hope; all denotes dumbness, desolation, and death. Natheless mine eyes shall not be dimmed in death, nor my senses secede from my spent frame, until I have besought from the gods a meet mulct for my betrayal, and implored the faith of the celestials with my latest breath. Wherefore ye requiters of men's deeds with avenging pains, O Eumenides, whose front enwreathed with serpent-locks blazons the wrath exhaled from your bosom, hither, hither haste, hear ye my plainings, which I, sad wretch, am urged to outpour from mine innermost marrow, helpless, burning, and blind <!-- Page 196
  --><a id="page196" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[196]"></a>with frenzied fury. And since in truth they spring from the veriest depths of my heart, be ye unwilling to allow my agony to pass unheeded, but with such mind as Theseus forsook me, with like mind, O goddesses, may he bring evil on himself and on his kin."</p>
<p>After she had poured forth these words from her grief-laden bosom, distractedly clamouring for requital against his heartless deeds, the celestial ruler assented with almighty nod, at whose motion the earth and the awe-full waters quaked, and the world of glittering stars did quiver. But Theseus, self-blinded with mental mist, let slip from forgetful breast all those injunctions which until then he had held firmly in mind, nor bore aloft sweet signals to his sad sire, shewing himself safe when in sight of Erectheus' haven. For 'tis said that aforetime, when Aegeus entrusted his son to the winds, on leaving the walls of the chaste goddess's city, these commands he gave to the youth with his parting embrace.</p>
<p>"O mine only son, far dearer to me than long life, lately restored to me at extreme end of my years, O son whom I must perforce dismiss to a doubtful hazard, since my ill fate and thine ardent valour snatch thee from unwilling me, whose dim eyes are not yet sated with my son's dear form: nor gladly and with joyous breast do I send thee, nor will I suffer thee to bear signs of helpful fortune, but first from my breast many a plaint will I express, sullying my grey hairs with dust and ashes, and then will I hang dusky sails to the swaying mast, so that <!-- Page 197
  --><a id="page197" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[197]"></a>our sorrow and burning lowe are shewn by Iberian canvas, rustily darkened. Yet if the dweller on holy Itone, who deigns defend our race and Erectheus' dwellings, grant thee to besprinkle thy right hand in the bull's blood, then see that in very truth these commandments deep-stored in thine heart's memory do flourish, nor any time deface them. Instant thine eyes shall see our cliffs, lower their gloomy clothing from every yard, and let the twisted cordage bear aloft snowy sails, where splendent shall shine bright topmast spars, so that, instant discerned, I may know with gladness and lightness of heart that in prosperous hour thou art returned to my face."</p>
<p>These charges, at first held in constant mind, from Theseus slipped away as clouds are impelled by the breath of the winds from the ethereal peak of a snow-clad mount. But his father as he betook himself to the castle's turrets as watchplace, dimming his anxious eyes with continual weeping, when first he spied the discoloured canvas, flung himself headlong from the top of the crags, deeming Theseus lost by harsh fate. Thus as he entered the grief-stricken house, his paternal roof, Theseus savage with slaughter met with like grief as that which with unmemoried mind he had dealt to Minos' daughter: while she with grieving gaze at his disappearing keel, turned over a tumult of cares in her wounded spirit.</p>
<p>But on another part [of the tapestry] swift hastened the flushed Iacchus with his train of Satyrs and Nisa-begot Sileni, thee questing, Ariadne, <!-- Page 198 --><a id="page198" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[198]"></a>and aflame with love for thee. * * * * These scattered all around, an inspired band, rushed madly with mind all distraught, ranting "Euhoe," with tossing of heads "Euhoe." Some with womanish hands shook thyrsi with wreath-covered points; some tossed limbs of a rended steer; some engirt themselves with writhed snakes; some enacted obscure orgies with deep chests, orgies of which the profane vainly crave a hearing; others beat the tambours with outstretched palms, or from the burnished brass provoked shrill tinklings, blew raucous-sounding blasts from many horns, and the barbarous pipe droned forth horrible song.</p>
<p>With luxury of such figures was the coverlet adorned, enwrapping the bed with its mantling embrace. After the Thessalian youthhood with eager engazing were sated they began to give way to the sacred gods. Hence, as with his morning's breath brushing the still sea Zephyrus makes the sloping billows uprise, when Aurora mounts 'neath the threshold of the wandering sun, which waves heave slowly at first with the breeze's gentle motion (plashing with the sound as of low laughter) but after, as swells the wind, more and more frequent they crowd and gleam in the purple light as they float away,—so quitting the royal vestibule did the folk hie them away each to his home with steps wandering hither and thither.</p>
<p>After they had wended their way, chief from the Pelion vertex Chiron came, the bearer of sylvan <!-- Page 199 --><a id="page199" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[199]"></a>spoil: for whatsoever the fields bear, whatso the Thessalian land on its high hills breeds, and what flowers the fecund air of warm Favonius begets near the running streams, these did he bear enwreathed into blended garlands wherewith the house rippled with laughter, caressed by the grateful odour.</p>
<p>Speedily stands present Penios, for a time his verdant Tempe, Tempe whose overhanging trees encircle, leaving to the Dorian choirs, damsels Magnesian, to frequent; nor empty-handed,—for he has borne hither lofty beeches uprooted and the tall laurel with straight stem, nor lacks he the nodding plane and the lithe sister of flame-wrapt Phaethon and the aerial cypress. These wreathed in line did he place around the palace so that the vestibule might grow green sheltered with soft fronds.</p>
<p>After him follows Prometheus of inventive mind, bearing diminishing traces of his punishment of aforetime, which of old he had suffered, with his limbs confined by chains hanging from the rugged Scythian crags. Then came the sire of gods from heaven with his holy consort and offspring, leaving thee alone, Phoebus, with thy twin-sister the fosterer of the mountains of Idrus: for equally with thyself did thy sister disdain Peleus nor was she willing to honour the wedding torches of Thetis. After they had reclined their snow-white forms along the seats, tables were loaded on high with food of various kinds. <!-- Page 200 --><a id="page200" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[200]"></a></p>
<p>In the meantime with shaking bodies and infirm gesture the Parcae began to intone their veridical chant. Their trembling frames were enwrapped around with white garments, encircled with a purple border at their heels, snowy fillets bound each aged brow, and their hands pursued their never-ending toil, as of custom. The left hand bore the distaff enwrapped in soft wool, the right hand lightly withdrawing the threads with upturned fingers did shape them, then twisting them with the prone thumb it turned the balanced spindle with well-polished whirl. And then with a pluck of their tooth the work was always made even, and the bitten wool-shreds adhered to their dried lips, which shreds at first had stood out from the fine thread. And in front of their feet wicker baskets of osier twigs took charge of the soft white woolly fleece. These, with clear-sounding voice, as they combed out the wool, outpoured fates of such kind in sacred song, in song which none age yet to come could tax with untruth.</p>
<p>"O with great virtues thine exceeding honour augmenting, stay of Emathia-land, most famous in thine issue, receive what the sisters make known to thee on this gladsome day, a weird veridical! But ye whom the fates do follow:—Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>
<p>"Now Hesperus shall come unto thee bearing what is longed for by bridegrooms, with that fortunate star shall thy bride come, who ensteeps thy soul with the sway of softening love, and prepares with thee <!--
  Page 201 --><a id="page201" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[201]"></a>to conjoin in languorous slumber, making her smooth arms thy pillow round 'neath thy sinewy neck. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>
<p>"No house ever yet enclosed such loves, no love bound lovers with such pact, as abideth with Thetis, as is the concord of Peleus. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>
<p>"To ye shall Achilles be born, a stranger to fear, to his foemen not by his back, but by his broad breast known, who, oft-times the victor in the uncertain struggle of the foot-race, shall outrun the fire-fleet footsteps of the speedy doe. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>
<p>"None in war with him may compare as a hero, when the Phrygian streams shall trickle with Trojan blood, and when besieging the walls of Troy with a long-drawn-out warfare perjured Pelops' third heir shall lay that city waste. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>
<p>"His glorious acts and illustrious deeds often shall mothers attest o'er funeral-rites of their sons, when the white locks from their heads are unloosed amid ashes, and they bruise their discoloured breasts with feeble fists. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>
<p>"For as the husbandman bestrewing the dense wheat-ears mows the harvest yellowed 'neath ardent sun, so shall he cast prostrate the corpses of Troy's sons with grim swords. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles. <!-- Page 202 --><a id="page202" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[202]"></a></p>
<p>"His great valour shall be attested by Scamander's wave, which ever pours itself into the swift Hellespont, narrowing whose course with slaughtered heaps of corpses he shall make tepid its deep stream by mingling warm blood with the water. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>
<p>"And she a witness in fine shall be the captive-maid handed to death, when the heaped-up tomb of earth built in lofty mound shall receive the snowy limbs of the stricken virgin. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>
<p>"For instant fortune shall give the means to the war-worn Greeks to break Neptune's stone bonds of the Dardanian city, the tall tomb shall be made dank with Polyxena's blood, who as the victim succumbing 'neath two-edged sword, with yielding hams shall fall forward a headless corpse. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>
<p>"Wherefore haste ye to conjoin in the longed-for delights of your love. Bridegroom thy goddess receive in felicitous compact; let the bride be given to her eager husband. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>
<p>"Nor shall the nurse at orient light returning, with yester-e'en's thread succeed in circling her neck. [Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.] Not need her solicitous mother fear sad discord shall cause a parted bed for her daughter, nor need she cease to hope for dear grandchildren. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles." <!-- Page 203 --><a id="page203" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[203]"></a></p>
<p>With such soothsaying songs of yore did the Parcae chant from divine breast the felicitous fate of Peleus. For of aforetime the heaven-dwellers were wont to visit the chaste homes of heroes and to shew themselves in mortal assembly ere yet their worship was scorned. Often the father of the gods, a-resting in his glorious temple, when on the festal days his annual rites appeared, gazed on an hundred bulls strewn prone on the earth. Often wandering Liber on topmost summit of Parnassus led his yelling Thyiads with loosely tossed locks. * * * * When the Delphians tumultuously trooping from the whole of their city joyously acclaimed the god with smoking altars. Often in lethal strife of war Mavors, or swift Triton's queen, or the Rhamnusian virgin, in person did exhort armed bodies of men. But after the earth was infected with heinous crime, and each one banished justice from their grasping mind, and brothers steeped their hands in fraternal blood, the son ceased grieving o'er departed parents, the sire craved for the funeral rites of his first-born that freely he might take of the flower of unwedded step-dame, the unholy mother, lying under her unknowing son, did not fear to sully her household gods with dishonour: everything licit and lawless commingled with mad infamy turned away from us the just-seeing mind of the gods. Wherefore nor do they deign to appear at such-like assemblies, nor will they permit themselves to be met in the day-light. <!-- Page 204
