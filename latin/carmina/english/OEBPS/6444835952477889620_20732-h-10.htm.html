<p>O quoties rigidâ pulsabis pallia venâ!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or with this quatrain of an old French poet:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Ainsi depuis une semaine</p>
<p>La longue roideur de ma veine,</p>
<p>Pour néant rouge et bien en point,</p>
<p>Bat ma chemise et mon pourpoint.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>C. xxxvii. <i>v.</i> 1. Taverns and Wine-shops in Rome were distinguished by pillars projecting into the streets, the better to catch the eye of the passenger, as sign-posts of inns do with us now; the tavern in question was a house of ill-fame, and we are told it was the ninth column or sign-post from the Temple of Castor and Pollux.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 2. It was customary to display on the fronts of brothels the names of the inmates, just as shopkeepers' names were inscribed over places of more reputable trade: this was called <i>inscriptio</i> or <i>titulus</i>.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 10. <i>Scorpionibus</i>. Indecent inscriptions scribbled on the walls and door with burnt sticks. <!-- Page 306 --><a id="page306" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[306]"></a></p>
<p><i>v.</i> 11. Catullus's mistress had, it seems, run away from him to a common brothel, in front of which it was the custom, not only for women but even for men, to sit down and offer themselves for prostitution.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 16. <i>Semitarii moechi</i>. Whoremongers who take up with common women who offer themselves at every corner of the streets for a mere trifle.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 20. <i>Hibera Urina</i>. We are assured by Strabo, <i>Lib.</i> 3, that this filthy custom prevailed greatly in Spain: teeth were not only washed in stale urine, the acid of which must necessarily render them white, but they were also rubbed with a powder of calcined human excrement. Persons sometimes even bathed their whole bodies in urine.</p>
<p>C. xxxxi. <i>v.</i> 3. <i>Turpiculo naso</i>. The kind of nose alluded to is such as sheep or goats have. Cf. Lucretius, <i>lib.</i> iv. v. 1152.</p>
<p>C. xxxxvii. <i>v.</i> 6. <i>In trivio</i>, i.e., in the most public places, in hopes of finding some host.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 7. This hunting for invitations does not, according to modern notions, place the two friends of Catullus in a respectable light; but it was a common and avowed practice at Rome.</p>
<p>C. liii. <i>v.</i> 5. <i>Salaputium</i>. A pet name for the male virile member. This word has been the subject of much debate among the learned. Some read <i>solopachium</i>, meaning a "mannikin eighteen inches high"; Saumasius proposes salopygium, a "wagtail"; several editors have <i>salaputium</i>, an indelicate word nurses used to children when they fondled them, so that the exclamation would mean, "what a learned little puppet!" Thus Augustus called Horace <i>purissimum penem</i>.</p>
<p>C. liiii. I find it an impossibility to make any sense out of this poem.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 5. <i>Seni recocto</i>. Horace applies this epithet to one who has served the office of <i>quinquevir</i>, or proconsul's notary, and who was therefore master of all the arts of chicanery. These are his words, Sat. v. lib. 2:</p>
<p><!-- Page 307 --><a id="page307" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[307]"></a></p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i16"><i>Plerumque recoctus</i></p>
<p><i>Scriba ex quinqueviro corvum deludit hiantem.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>A seasoned scrivener, bred in office low,</p>
<p>Full often dupes and mocks the gaping crow. <span class="sc">Francis.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The modern Italians say of a man of this stamp, <i>Egli ha cotto il culo ne' ceci rossi</i>. The phrase <i>seni recocto</i> may imply one who enjoys a green and vigorous old age, as if made young again, as the old woman was by wine, of whom Petronius speaks, <i>Anus recocta vino</i>; or Æson, who was re-cooked by Medaea. That witch, says Valerius Flaccus, <i>Recoquit fessos aetate parentes</i>.</p>
<p>C. lvi. <i>v.</i> 6. <i>Trusantem</i>. Many read <i>crissantem</i>, which means the movement of the loins in women; <i>ceventem</i> being the like of a man. As the expression refers to the lad, <i>crissantem</i> cannot be correct.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 7. <i>Pro telo</i>. Alluding to the custom of punishing adulterers by transfixing them with darts. The double-entendre of <i>Telo</i> with <i>Mentula</i> is evident, and makes clear the apology to Venus. See <i>lib.</i> 9 of Apuleius for a similar passage.</p>
<p>C. lvii. <i>v.</i> 7. <i>Erudituli</i>. The accomplishments alluded to are not literary, but Priapeian. It is in this sense Petronius calls Gito <i>doctissimus puer</i>. Œzema, a grave German jurist, parodied a part of this piece. His epigram can be read without danger of having one's stomach turned.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Belle convenit inter elegantes</p>
<p>Dione's famulas, et eruditos</p>
<p>Antiquae Themidis meos sodales.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>"There is a charming coincidence of sentiment between the fair votaries of Venus and my learned brethren: we profess law and justice; they dearly love the thing that is upright."</p>
<p>C. lviii. <i>v.</i> 1. <i>Caeli</i>. This is the same with Caelius Rufus, Catullus's rival in the affections of Lesbia, or Clodia, according to Achilles Statius; Plutarch calls her Quadrantaria; she was debauched by her own brother, Publius Clodius; afterwards she became the mistress of Catullus, and lastly the common strumpet of Rome. <!-- Page 308
  --><a id="page308" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[308]"></a></p>
<p><i>v.</i> 4. The meanest trulls frequented the public streets.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 5. <i>Glubit</i>. <i>Glubo</i> = to husk (corn), hence it is tropically used to denote masturbation. Cf. Ausonius, epigram 71.</p>
<p>C. lviiii. <i>v.</i> 1. <i>Fellat</i>. This refers to the complacent use by the female of her lips in the act of connection.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 3. The half-starved women of pleasure attended at funerals in the hope of picking up parts of the viands which were laid on the pile and burnt with the body.</p>
<p>C. lxi. <i>v.</i> 22. <i>Myrtus Asia</i>. The Asia of Catullus was that marshy tract of land near Mount Tmolus and the River Caystrus. Cf. Homer (<i>Il.</i> ii. 461) for the "Ancient Meadow." It was said to be as famous for its myrtles as for its cranes. Proper "Asia Minor" is the title first used by Oratius (Orazius?) (1. 2.) in the IVth century. See the "Life and Works of St. Paul," by Dr. Farrar (i. 465).—<i>R. F. B.</i></p>
<p><i>v.</i> 54. <i>Timens</i>. Many more obscenely write <i>tumens</i>, thus changing the "fear-full" bridegroom into the "swollen" bridegroom.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 123. It was usual for the mirthful friends of the newly married couple to sing obscene songs called <i>Fescennine</i>, which were tolerated on this occasion.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 124. <i>Nec nuces pueris</i>. This custom of throwing nuts, such as walnuts or almonds, is of Athenian origin; some say it was meant to divert the attention from the raptures of the bride and bridegroom, when in bed, by the noise they, and the scrambling boys, made on the floor. For <i>nuces</i>, referring to the use of boys, see Verg. Eclogue 8.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 125. <i>Concubinus</i>. By the shamelessness of this passage, it would seem to be quite a usual thing amongst the youthful Roman aristocracy to possess a bedfellow of their own sex.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 137. "This coarse imitation of the Fescennine poems," says Dunlop (History of Roman Literature), "leaves on our minds a stronger impression of the prevalence and extent of Roman vices than any other passage in the Latin classics. Martial, and Catullus himself elsewhere, have branded their enemies; and Juvenal, in bursts of satiric <!-- Page
  309 --><a id="page309" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[309]"></a>indignation, has reproached his countrymen with the blackest crimes. But here, in a complimentary poem to a patron and intimate friend, these are jocularly alluded to as the venial indulgence of his earliest youth."</p>
<p>C. lxii. <i>v.</i> 39, <i>et seq.</i> Thus exquisitely rendered by Spenser, Faery Queen, b. ii. c. 12:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">The whiles some one did chaunt this lovely lay:</p>
<p class="i4">"Ah! see, whoso fayre thing doest faine to see,</p>
<p class="i2">In springing flowre the image of thy day!</p>
<p class="i4">Ah! see the virgin rose, how sweetly she</p>
<p class="i4">Doth first peepe foorth with bashfull modestie,</p>
<p class="i2">That fairer seemes the lesse ye see her may!</p>
<p class="i4">Lo see soone after how more bold and free</p>
<p class="i2">Her bared bosome she doth broad display;</p>
<p>Lo! see soone after how she fades and falls away!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"So passeth, in the passing of a day,</p>
<p class="i4">Of mortal life the leafe, the bud, the flowre;</p>
<p class="i2">Ne more doth flourish after first decay,</p>
<p class="i4">That erst was sought to deck both bed and bowre</p>
<p class="i4">Of many a lady, and many a paramoure!</p>
<p class="i2">Gather therefore the rose whilest yet is prime,</p>
<p class="i4">For soone comes age that will her pride deflowre;</p>
<p class="i2">Gather the rose of love whilest yet is time,</p>
<p>Whilest loving thou mayst loved be with equal crime."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>C. lxiii. <i>v.</i> 23. Women devoted to the service of Bacchus or of Cybele; for many things were common to the rights of both deities. The name is derived from <span title="mainesthai" class="grk">μαινεσθαι</span>, to rave.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 28. <i>Thiasus</i> is properly a chorus of sacred singers and dancers, living in a community, like a college of dervishes, who, indeed, are an exact counterpart of the Galli as regards their howling and dancing ritual, but have the advantage of their predecessors in one important particular, <i>i.e.</i>, they are not castrated.</p>
<p>C. lxiiii. <i>v.</i> 65. The strophium was a band which confined the breasts and restrained the exuberance of their growth. Martial apostrophizes it thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Fascia, crescentes dominae compesce papillas,</p>
<p>Ut sit quod capiat nostra tegatque manus.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"Confine the growth of my fair one's breasts, that they may be just large enough for my hand to enclose them." <!-- Page 310 --><a id="page310" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[310]"></a></p>
<p><i>v.</i> 377. <i>Circumdare filo</i>. That is, may you to-morrow prove that you are no longer a virgin; for the ancients had an idea that the neck swelled after venery; perhaps from the supposed descent of the procreative fluid which they thought lodged in the brain. See Hippocrates and Aristotle upon this subject. The swelling of the bride's neck was therefore ascertained by measurement with a thread on the morning after the nuptials, and was held to be sufficient proof of their happy consummation. The ancients, says Pezay, had faith in another equally absurd test of virginity. They measured the circumference of the neck with a thread. Then the girl under trial took the two ends of the magic thread in her teeth, and if it was found to be so long that its bight could be passed over her head, it was clear she was not a maid. By this rule all the thin girls might pass for vestals, and all the plump ones for the reverse.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 403. Semiramis is said to have done thus by her son Ninus.</p>
<p>C. lxv. <i>v.</i> 19. The gift of an apple had a very tender meaning; according to Vossius it was <i>quasi pignus concubitus</i>, that is to say, it was the climax</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>To all those token flowers that tell</p>
<p>What words can never speak so well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In one of the love epistles of Aristaenetus, Phalaris complains to her friend Petala, how her younger sister, who had accompanied her to dine with Pamphilus, her lover, attempted to seduce him, and among other wanton tricks did as follows: "Pamphilus, biting off a piece of an apple, chucked it dexterously into her bosom; she took it, kissed it, and thrusting it under her sash, hid it between her breasts." Cf. note to C. ii. <i>v.</i> 12, <i>ante.</i></p>
<p>C. lxvii. <i>v.</i> 21. <i>Languidior</i>. This expression, here obscenely applied, is proverbial, from the flagging of the leaves of the beet; hence the Latin word <i>batizare</i>, to droop, used by Suetonius, <i>in Augusto</i>. See Pliny on this plant, Cap. xiii. <i>lib.</i> 9.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 28. <i>Zonam Solvere</i>. See the note to C. ii. <i>v.</i> 13.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 30. <i>Minxerit in gremium</i>. Horace uses the word <i>mingere</i> in the same sense:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Dicitur ut formae melioris meïat eodem</i>.</p>
<p class="i16">Hor. Sat. vii. <i>lib.</i> 2.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><!-- Page 311 --><a id="page311" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[311]"></a></p>
<p>and in like manner Persius</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Patriciae immeïat vulvae.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Pliny more than once uses the word <i>urina pro semine</i>.</p>
<p>C. lxviiii. <i>v.</i> 6. <i>Sub alarum</i>. Many would join these two words and form one, which, however, is not authorised by any ancient writer. The Spaniards, it is true, say <i>sobaco</i>, the armpit, but this does not justify a new Latin coinage of any similar word. The smell alluded to in this line has often been compared to that of a goat; it is called <i>capram</i>, <i>caprum</i>, and <i>hircam</i>. Thus Horace, Epod. 12,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i16"><i>Namque sagacius unus odoror</i></p>
<p><i>Polypus an gravis hirsutis cubet hircus in alis.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This tetterous complaint is peculiar to warm countries; we know scarcely anything of it in our northern climate.</p>
<p>C. lxxiiii. <i>v.</i> 6. The reader will easily guess that one reason for the uncle's inability to murmur was owing to the occupation which Gellius had thrust on him.</p>
<p>C. lxxvii. <i>v.</i> 8. <i>Suavia comminxit</i>. This habit, which the filthy Rufus adopts, is mentioned by Lucretius:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i16"><i>Jungunt salivas</i></p>
<p><i>Oris, et inspirant pressantes dentibus ora.</i></p>
<p class="i24">Lucret. <i>lib.</i> 4.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>C. lxxx. <i>v.</i> 6. Martial has a similar expression,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Lambebat medios improba lingua viros</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>v.</i> 8. <i>Ilia, et emulso</i>. Lucretius uses the word <i>mulgere</i> in the same sense in lib. 4.</p>
<p>C. lxxxiiii. <i>v.</i> 2. The first notice in the classics of our far-famed 'Arry, whose female is 'Arriet.—<i>R. F. B.</i></p>
<p>C. lxxxviiii. <i>v.</i> 1. The good condition and number of the relations of Gellius are assigned as the causes of his macilency, Gellius being an adulterer of the most infamous kind. Thus Propertius, on the amorous disposition peculiar to those of a spare make,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>What tho' my slender shape enervate seem,</p>
<p>Think not that vigour flies my meagre frame;</p>
<!-- Page 312 --><a id="page312" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[312]"></a>
<p>At Venus' rites I ne'er was known to fail,</p>
<p>Th' experienc'd fair can this dear truth reveal.</p>
<p class="i24">Proper., <i>Eleg.</i> 22. <i>lib.</i> 2.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>C. lxxxx. <i>v.</i> 6. <i>Omentum</i>. The sages used to draw omens from the entrails of sacrificed beasts as they were burning; but more particularly from the <i>omentum</i>, or <i>caul</i>, that apron of fat which covers the abdominal viscera.</p>
<p>C. lxxxxiiii. <i>v.</i> 1. There is a double meaning in the original, and the translator can give but half of it. <i>Mentula</i>, synonymous with <i>penis</i>, is a nickname applied by Catullus to Mamurra, of whom he says (cxv.) that he is not a man, but a great thundering <i>mentula</i>. Mahérault has happily rendered the meaning of the epigram in French, in which language there is an equivalent for Mentula, that is to say, a man's name which is also a popular synonym for what characterizes the god Priapus. "Jean Chouard fornique; eh! sans doute, c'est bien Jean Chouard. C'est ainsi qu'on peut dire que c'est la marmite qui cueille les choux." Achilles Statius interprets this <i>distich</i> thus, "It is the flesh that is guilty, and not I who am guilty; so is it the pot that robs the garden, and not the thief that robs the pot-herbs."</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 2. <i>Ipsa olera olla legat</i>. This may have been a cant proverb of the day containing a meaning which is now unknown to us. Parthenius interprets it "A libidinous man is apt in adultery, as a vessel is suited to hold its contents."</p>
<p>C. lxxxxvii. <i>v.</i> 1. There is in the Greek Anthology a similar epigram by Nicarchus, which has thus been translated by Grotius:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Non culo, Theodore, minus tibi foetida bucca est</p>
<p class="i2">Noscera discrimen sit sapientis opus.</p>
<p>Scribere debueras hîc podex est meus, hic os;</p>
<p class="i2">Nunc tu cum pedas atque loquare simul,</p>
<p>Discere non valeo, quid venerit inde vel inde;</p>
<p class="i2">Vipera namque infra sibilat atque supra.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>v.</i> 7. Few are ignorant of what Scaliger here gravely tells us: <i>fessi muli strigare solent, ut meiant</i>. Vossius reads <i>defissus</i>, in a different sense. <!-- Page 313 --><a id="page313" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[313]"></a></p>
<p>C. lxxxxviiii. This poem shews beyond contradiction that Catullus himself was not free from the vice of paederasty, so universal amongst the Roman youth.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 10. <i>Lupae</i>. The infamous, fetid harlot is called <i>lupa</i> (a she-wolf) from the ravenousness of the wolf answering to the rapacious disposition of the generality of courtezans: but Servius, <i>Aen.</i> 3, assigns a much more improper and filthy reason.</p>
<p>C. c. <i>v.</i> 1. Again the Roman paederasty shews itself in Caelius's affection for Aufilenus.</p>
<p>C. ciii. It appears that Catullus had given a sum of money to the pander Silo to procure him a mistress. He did not perform his engagement, but kept the money, and abused our sinning bard when he reproached him with the cheat.</p>
<p>C. cv. There are not wanting commentators who give a very obscene turn to this epigram against Mamurra.</p>
<p>C. cx. <i>v.</i> 4. The word <i>dare</i> has here an erotic sense.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 8. <i>Tota corpore prostituit</i>. Some commentators think that this alludes to such women as not only submit to prostitution, but are in every way subservient to the lascivious caprices of depraved appetites. Vossius inclines to such an interpretation.</p>
<p>C. cxii. <i>v.</i> 2. <i>Multus</i>. Some commentators read <i>moltus</i> in an obscene sense, <i>à molendo</i>. Vossius understands by <i>descendere in sese</i> the same act as is alluded to in C. lxxxviii., hence the force of the word <i>multus</i>, meaning <i>cum feminâ</i>, which he jeeringly applies to Naso as though he would ironically exclaim: <i>Et tu feminâ! tu solus es, aut sine feminâ</i>. He writes the epigram thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Multus homo est, Naso, neque secum multus homo qui</i></p>
<p><i>Descendit? Naso, multus es et pathicus?</i></p>

<br/>
<br/>1.F.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
<br/>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
<br/>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
<br/>"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
<br/>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
<br/>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
<br/>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
<br/>your equipment.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
<br/>of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
<br/>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
<br/>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
<br/>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
<br/>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
<br/>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
<br/>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
<br/>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br/>DAMAGE.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
<br/>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
<br/>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
<br/>written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
<br/>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
<br/>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
<br/>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
<br/>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
<br/>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
<br/>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
<br/>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
<br/>opportunities to fix the problem.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
<br/>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

<br/>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
<br/>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
<br/>law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
<br/>interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
<br/>the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
<br/>provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
<br/>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
<br/>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
<br/>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
<br/>promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
<br/>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
<br/>that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
<br/>or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
<br/>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
<br/>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
<br/>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
<br/>people in all walks of life.
<br/>
<br/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
<br/>assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
<br/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
<br/>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
<br/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
<br/>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
<br/>and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

<br/>
<br/>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
<br/>Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
<br/>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
<br/>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
<br/>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
<br/>array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
<br/>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
<br/>status with the IRS.
<br/>
<br/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
<br/>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
<br/>States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
<br/>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
<br/>with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
<br/>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<br/>SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
<br/>particular state visit http://pglaf.org
<br/>
<br/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
<br/>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
<br/>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
<br/>approach us with offers to donate.
<br/>
<br/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
<br/>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
<br/>outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
<br/>
<br/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
<br/>methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
<br/>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
<br/>To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

<br/>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works.
<br/>
<br/>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
<br/>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
<br/>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
<br/>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
<br/>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<br/>
<br/>     http://www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
<br/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
<br/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
<br/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
