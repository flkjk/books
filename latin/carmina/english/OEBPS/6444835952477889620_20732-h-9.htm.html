<p>I snatched from thee, whilst thou wast sporting, O honied Juventius, a kiss sweeter than sweet ambrosia. But I bore it off not unpunished; for more than an hour do I remember myself hung on the summit of the cross, whilst I purged myself [for my crime] to thee, nor could any tears in the least remove your anger. For instantly it was done, thou didst bathe thy lips with many drops, and didst cleanse them with every finger-joint, lest anything remained from the conjoining of our mouths, as though it were the obscene slaver of a fetid fricatrice. Nay, more, thou hast handed wretched me over to despiteful Love, nor hast thou ceased to agonize me in every way, so that for me that kiss is now changed from ambrosia to be harsher than harsh hellebore. Since thou dost award such punishment to wretched amourist, never more after this will I steal kisses.</p>

<p>Aufilena, honest harlots are always praised: they accept the price of what they intend to do. Thou didst promise that to me, which, being a feigned promise, proves thee unfriendly; not giving that, and often accepting, thou dost wrongfully. Either to do it frankly, or not to promise from modesty, Aufilena, was becoming thee: but to snatch the gift and bilk, proves thee worse than the greedy strumpet who prostitutes herself with every part of her body.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00011">NOTES</h3>
<p class="cenhead">EXPLANATORY AND ILLUSTRATIVE</p>
<p>Carmen ii. <i>v.</i> 1. Politian, commenting on Catullus, held in common with Lampridius, Turnebus and Vossius that Lesbia's sparrow was an indecent allegory, like the "grey duck" in Pope's imitation of Chaucer. Sannazarius wrote an Epigram smartly castigating Politian, the closing lines of which were to the effect that the critic would like to devour the bird:—</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i12">Meus hic Pulicianus</p>
<p>Tam bellum sibi passerem Catulli</p>
<p>Intra viscera habere concupiscit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Martial says:</p>
<blockquote class="b1n"><div>
<p>"Kiss me and I will give you Catullus's sparrow,</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>by which he does not mean a poem.</p>
<p>And in the Apophoreta:</p>
<blockquote class="b1n"><div>
<p>"If you have such a sparrow as Catullus's Lesbia deplored, it may lodge here."</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Chaulieu has a similar Epigram:—</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Autant et plus que sa vie</p>
<p>Phyllis aime un passereau;</p>
<p>Ainsi la jeune Lesbie</p>
<p>Jadis aima son moineau.</p>
<p>Mais de celui de Catulle</p>
<p>Se laissant aussi charmer,</p>
<p>Dans sa cage, sans scrupule,</p>
<p>Elle eut soin de l' enfermer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Héguin de Guerle however sees nothing to justify this opinion, remarking that Catullus was not the man to use a <!-- Page 300 --><a id="page300" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[300]"></a>veil of allegory in saying an indecency. "He preferred the bare, and even coarse, word; and he is too rich in this style of writing to need the loan of equivocal passages."</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 12. The story of the race between Hippomenes and Atalanta, and how the crafty lover tricked the damsel into defeat by the three golden apples is well known. Cf. Ovid. Metam. lib. x. <i>v.</i> 560, et seq. According to Vossius the gift of an apple was equivalent to a promise of the last favour. The Emperor Theodosius caused Paulinus to be murdered for receiving an apple from his Empress. As to this, cf. the "Tale of the Three Apples," in <i>The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night</i> (Sir Richard Burton's Translation, Benares, 1885-8, 16 volumes), vol. i. p. 191. Cf. also note to C. lxv. <i>v.</i> 19.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 13. Virgins wore a girdle, generally of wool, for wool by the ancients was supposed to excite love, which the bridegroom the first night unbound in bed. Both in Greek and in Latin the phrase <i>to undo the zone</i> was used to signify the loss of virginity.</p>
<p>C. vi. <i>v.</i> 8. Some say this is the spikenard, and the same with the Syrian <i>malobathrum</i>. But any rich odour was termed Syrian, by the Romans, who were extravagantly fond of perfumes; and used them, according to Vulpius, as provocatives to venery.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 9. <i>Pulvinus</i>, not <i>pulvinar</i>. Cf. carmen lxiiii. <i>v.</i> 47, post.</p>
<p>C. vii. <i>v.</i> 6. Battus (in Libyan) Bahatus, a chief, a ruler.—Halevy Essai, p. 164.—<i>R. F. B.</i></p>
<p>C. viii. <i>v.</i> 18. Plautus speaks of Teneris labellis molles morsiunculae. Thus too Horace:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i12">Sive puer furens</p>
<p>Impressit memorem dente labris notam.</p>

<div class="stanza">

<p>Marks with his teeth the furious joy. <i>Francis</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>Plutarch tells us that Flora, the mistress of Cn. Pompey, used to say in commendation of her lover, that she could never quit his arms without giving him a bite. <!-- Page 301 --><a id="page301" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[301]"></a></p>
<p>C. xi. <i>v.</i> 5. In the Classics, Arabs always appear as a soft effeminate race; under primitive Christianity as heretics; and after the seventh century as conquerors, men of letters, philosophers, mediciners, magicians and alchemists.—<i>R. F. B.</i></p>
<p><i>v.</i> 20. <i>Ilia rumpens</i>. More exactly rendered by Biacca:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i12">E sol di tutti</p>
<p>Tenta l'iniqua ad isnervar i fianchi.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Guarini says of a coquette, that she likes to do with lovers as with gowns, have plenty of them, use one after another, and change them often.</p>
<p>C. xiii. <i>v.</i> 9. I understand this, "Thou shalt depart after supper carrying with thee all our hearts."—<i>R. F. B.</i></p>
<p>C. xiiii. <i>v.</i> 15. Whence our Christmas-day, the Winter Solstice connected with Christianity. There are only four universal festivals—"Holy days,"—and they are all of solar origin—The Solstices and the Equinoxes.—<i>R. F. B.</i></p>
<p>C. xv. <i>v.</i> 7. The Etymology of "platea" shows it to be a street widening into a kind of <i>place</i>, as we often find in the old country towns of Southern Europe.—<i>R. F. B.</i></p>
<p><i>v.</i> 18. <i>Patente porta</i>. This may be read "Your house door being open so that each passer may see your punishment," or it may be interpreted as referring to the punishment itself, <i>i.e.</i>, through the opened buttocks.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 19. This mode of punishing adulterers was first instituted amongst the Athenians. The victim being securely tied, a mullet was thrust up his fundament and withdrawn, the sharp gills of the fish causing excruciating torment to the sufferer during the process of its withdrawal, and grievously lacerating the bowels. Sometimes an enormous radish was substituted for the mullet. According to an epigram quoted by Vossius from the Anthologia, Alcaeus, the comic writer, died under this very punishment.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Lo here Alcaeus sleeps; whom earth's green child,</p>
<p>The broad-leaved radish, lust's avenger, kill'd.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>C. xvi. <i>v.</i> 1. <i>Paedicabo et irrumabo.</i> These detestable words are used here only as coarse forms of threatening, with no very definite meaning. It is certain that they were very <!-- Page 302
  --><a id="page302" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[302]"></a>commonly employed in this way, with no more distinct reference to their original import than the corresponding phrases of the modern Italians, <i>T' ho in culo</i> and <i>becco fottuto</i>, or certain brutal exclamations common in the mouths of the English vulgar.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 5. Ovid has a distich to the same effect:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Crede mihi, distant mores a carmine nostri;</p>
<p>Vita verecunda est, musa jocosa mihi.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"Believe me there is a vast difference between my morals and my song; my life is decorous, my muse is wanton." And Martial says:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Lasciva est nobis pagina, vita proba est.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Which is thus translated by Maynard:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Si ma plume est une putain,</p>
<p class="i2">Ma vie est une sainte.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Pliny quotes this poem of Catullus to excuse the wantonness of his own verses, which he is sending to his friend Paternus; and Apuleius cites the passage in his Apology for the same purpose. "Whoever," says Lambe, "would see the subject fully discussed, should turn to the Essay on the Literary Character by Mr. Disraeli." He enumerates as instances of free writers who have led pure lives, La Motte le Vayer, Bayle, la Fontaine, Smollet, and Cowley. "The imagination," he adds, "may be a volcano, while the heart is an Alp of ice." It would, however, be difficult to enlarge this list, while on the other hand, the catalogue of those who really practised the licentiousness they celebrated, would be very numerous. One period alone, the reign of Charles the Second, would furnish more than enough to outnumber the above small phalanx of purity. Muretus, whose poems clearly gave him every right to knowledge on the subject, but whose known debauchery would certainly have forbidden any credit to accrue to himself from establishing the general purity of lascivious poets, at once rejects the probability of such a contrast, saying:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Quisquis versibus exprimit Catullum</p>
<p>Raro moribus exprimit Catonem.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"One who is a Catullus in verse, is rarely a Cato in morals." <!--
  Page 303 --><a id="page303" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[303]"></a></p>
<p>C. xviii. This and the two following poems are found in the Catalecta of Vergilius, but they are assigned to Catullus by many of the best critics, chiefly on the authority of Terentianus Maurus.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 2. Cf. <i>Auct. Priapeiorum</i>, Eps. lv. <i>v.</i> 6, and lxxvii. <i>v.</i> 15.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 3. <i>Ostreosior</i>. This Epithet, peculiarly Catullian, is appropriate to the coasts most favoured by Priapus; oysters being an incentive to lust.</p>
<p>C. xx. <i>v.</i> 19. The traveller mocks at Priapus' threat of sodomy, regarding it as a pleasure instead of as a punishment. The god, in anger, retorts that if that punishment has no fears for him, a fustigation by the farmer with the self-same mentule used as a cudgel may have a more deterrent effect. Cf. <i>Auct. Priap.</i> Ep. li. <i>v.</i> 27, 28:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Nimirum apertam convolatis ad poenam:</p>
<p>Et vos hoc ipsum, quod minamur, invitat.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Without doubt, ye flock to the open punishment [so called because the natural parts of Priapus were always exposed to view], and the very thing with which I threaten, allures you.</p>
<p>And also Ep. lxiv.,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Quidam mollior anseris medulla,</p>
<p class="i2">Furatum venit hoc amor poenae.</p>
<p class="i2">Furetur licet usque non videbo.</p>

<p>C. xxiii. <i>v.</i> 6. Dry and meagre as wood; like the woman of whom Scarron says, that she never snuffed the candle with her fingers for fear of setting them on fire.</p>
<p>C. xxv. <i>v.</i> 1. Cf. Auct. Priap. Ep. xlv.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 5. This is a Catullian <i>crux</i>. Mr. Arthur Palmer (Trinity College, Dublin, Jan. 31, 1890) proposes, and we adopt—</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Cum diva miluorum aves ostendit oscitantes."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>(When the Goddess of Kites shows you birds agape.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Diva miluorum is—Diva furum, Goddess of thieves; <i>i.e.</i>, Laverna Milvus (hawk) being generally used for a rapacious <!-- Page 304
  --><a id="page304" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[304]"></a>robber. Mr. Palmer quotes Plaut. (Poen. 5, 5, 13; Pers. 3, 4, 5; Bacch. 2, 3, 40), and others.—<i>R. F. B.</i></p>
<p><i>v.</i> 6. <i>Involasti</i>, thou didst swoop—still metaphor of the prey-bird.—<i>R. F. B.</i></p>
<p>C. xxvi. <i>v.</i> 3. Still the "Bora" of the Adriatic, extending, with intervals, from Trieste to Bari. It is a N.N. Easter of peculiar electrical properties, causing extreme thirst, wrecking ships, upsetting mail-trains, and sweeping carriages and horses into the sea. Austral, the south wind, is represented in these days by the Scirocco, S.S.E. It sets out from Africa a dry wind, becomes supersaturated in the Mediterranean, and is the scourge of Southern Italy, exhausting the air of ozone and depressing the spirits and making man utterly useless and miserable.—<i>R. F. B.</i></p>
<p>C. xxviii. <i>v.</i> 10. These expressions, like those in carmen xvi. ante, are merely terms of realistically gross abuse.</p>
<p>C. xxviiii. <i>v.</i> 5. <i>Cinaede Romule</i>. The epithet is here applied in its grossest sense, which again is implied in the allusion to the spoil of Pontus; for this, as Vossius proves, can only be understood to mean the wealth obtained by Caesar, when a young man, through his infamous relations with Nicomedes, king of Pontus—as witness two lines sung by Caesar's own soldiers on the occasion of his triumph:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Ecce Caesar nunc triumphat, qui subegit Galliam;</p>
<p>Nicomedes non triumphat, qui subegit Caesarem.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>v.</i> 13. <i>Defututa Mentula</i> = a worn-out voluptuary. Mentula is a cant term which Catullus frequently uses for a libidinous person, and particularly for Mamurra.</p>
<p><i>v.</i> 24. Pompey married Caesar's daughter, Julia, and is commonly supposed to be the "son-in-law" here meant; but Vossius argues with some force, that <i>socer</i> and <i>gener</i> apply, not to Caesar and Pompey, but to Caesar and Mamurra. Those words, and the corresponding terms in Greek, were often used in an unnatural sense, as for instance in an epigram on Noctuinus, attributed to Calvus, in which occurs this very line, <i>Gener socerque perdidistis omnia</i>. <!-- Page 305 --><a id="page305" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[305]"></a></p>
<p>C. xxxi. <i>v.</i> 1. As the Venice-Trieste railway runs along the southern bar of the pyriform narrow, Lago di Garda, with its towering mountains, whose heads are usually in the storm-clouds, and whose feet sink into the nearest vineyards, the traveller catches a sight of the Sirmio Spit, long and sandy. It is a narrow ridge boldly projecting into the lake (once called Benacus) which was formerly a marsh, but now made into an island by the simple process of ditch cutting: at the southern end is the Sermione hill and its picturesque Scottish-German Castle. To the north are some ruins supposed to be the old Villa of Catullus, but they seem too extensive to serve for the purpose.—<i>R. F. B.</i></p>
<p>C. xxxii. <i>v.</i> 11. Pezay, a French translator, strangely mistakes the meaning of the passage, as if it amounted to this, "I have gorged till I am ready to burst;" and he quotes the remark of "une femme charmante," who said that her only reply to such a billet-doux would have been to send the writer an emetic. But the lady might have prescribed a different remedy if she had been acquainted with Martial's line:</p>
