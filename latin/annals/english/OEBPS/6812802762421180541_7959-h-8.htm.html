<body class="x-ebookmaker"><p>By this success, with such valour gained, and followed with such renown, the army was become elated and resolute. With fierce din they cried, "That to their bravery nothing could prove insurmountable. They must penetrate into the heart of Caledonia, and advance in a continual succession of battles, till they had at last found the utmost limits of Britain." Thus it was that they, who a little before had been so wary and so wise, were now, after the event was determined, grown full of boasts and intrepidity. Such is the lot of warfare, very unequal and unjust: in success all men assume part: the disasters are all imputed to one. Now the Britons, conjecturing the victory to proceed not from superior courage, but from circumstances improved and the address of our General, lost nothing of their spirit and defiance, but armed their young men, removed their wives and children into places of security, and in general conventions of their several communities engaged them in a league ratified by solemn sacrifices. And thus they mutually retired for the winter, with minds on both sides abundantly irritated.</p>
<p>During the same summer, a cohort of Usipians levied in Germany and thence transported to Britain, adventured upon a feat very desperate and memorable. When they had slain the Centurion and soldiers placed amongst them for training them in discipline, and to serve them for patterns and directors, they embarked in three pinnaces, forcing the pilots to conduct them; and since one of these forsook them and fled away, they suspected and therefore killed the other two. As the attempt was not yet divulged, their launching into the deep was beheld as a wonder. Anon they were tossed hither and thither at the mercy of the waves: and, as they often engaged for spoil with several of the Britons, obliging them to defend their property thus invaded, in which conflicts they frequently proved victorious, and were sometimes defeated, they were at last reduced to want so pressing, as to feed upon one another, first upon the weakest, then upon whomsoever the lot fell. In this manner were they carried round about Britain, and having lost their vessels through ignorance how to manage them, they were accounted robbers and pirates, and fell into the hands first of the Suevians, afterwards of the Frisians. Nay, as they were bought and sold for slaves, some of them, through change of masters, were brought over to our side of the Rhine, and grew famous from the discovery of an adventure so extraordinary.</p>
<p>A.D. 84. In the beginning of the summer, Agricola suffered a sore blow in his family, by losing his son born about a year before. A misfortune which he neither bore with an ostentation of firmness and unconcern, like many other men of magnanimity, nor with lamentations and tears worthy only of women. Besides that for this affliction, war proved one of his remedies. When therefore he had sent forward the navy, which by committing devastations in several places, would not fail to spread a mighty and perplexing terror, he put himself at the head of his army lightly equipped, and to it had added some of the bravest Britons, such as had been well proved through a long course of peace. Thus he arrived at the Grampian Hills, upon which the enemy were already encamped. For, the Britons, nothing daunted by the issue of the former battle, and boldly waiting either to take vengeance or to suffer bondage, taught withal at last, that a general union was the best way to repel common danger, had by embassies and confederacies drawn together the forces of all their communities. Even then were to be seen thirty thousand men in arms, and their youth from every quarter were still continuing to flock in, as were also such of their elderly men as were yet vigorous and hale, they who were signal in war, and now carried with them their several ensigns of honour formerly gained in the field. And now Galgacus, he who amongst their several leaders surpassed all in valour and descent, is said to have spoke in this strain to the multitude all very pressing for battle,</p>
<p>"Whenever I contemplate the causes of the war, and the necessity to which we are reduced, great is my confidence that this day and this union of yours will prove the beginning of universal liberty to Britain. For, besides that bondage is what we have never borne, we are so beset that beyond us there is no further land; nor in truth is there any security left us from the sea whilst the Roman fleet is hovering upon our coasts. Thus the same expedient which proves honourable to brave men, is to cowards too become the safest of all others, even present recourse to battle and arms. The other Britons, in their past conflicts with the Romans, whence they found various success, had still a remaining source of hope and succour in this our nation. For, of all the people of Britain we are the noblest, and thence placed in its innermost regions, and, as we behold not so much as the coasts of such as are slaves, we thus preserve even our eyes free and unprofaned by the sight of lawless and usurped rule. To us who are the utmost inhabitants of the earth, to us the last who enjoy liberty, this extremity of the globe, this remote tract unknown even to common fame, has to this day proved the only protection and defence. At present the utmost boundary of Britain is laid open; and to conquer parts unknown, is thought matter of great pomp and boasting. Beyond us no more people are found, nor aught save seas and rocks; and already the Romans have advanced into the heart of our country. Against their pride and domineering you will find it in vain to seek a remedy or refuge from any obsequiousness or humble behaviour of yours. Plunderers of the earth these, who in their universal devastations finding countries to fail them, investigate and rob even the sea. If the enemy be wealthy, he inflames their avarice; if poor, their ambition. They are general spoilers, such as neither the eastern world nor the western can satiate. They only of all men thirst after acquisitions both poor and rich, with equal avidity and passion. To spoil, to butcher, and to commit every kind of violence, they style by a lying name, <i>Government</i>; and when they have spread a general desolation, they call it <i>Peace</i>. {Footnote: "Ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant."}</p>
<p>"Dearest to every man are his children and kindred, by the contrivance and designation of nature. These are snatched from us for recruits, and doomed to bondage in other parts of the earth. Our wives and sisters, however they escape rapes and violence as from open enemies, are debauched under the appearance and privilege of friendship and hospitality. Our fortunes and possessions they exhaust for tribute, our grain for their provisions. Even our bodies and limbs are extenuated and wasted, while we are doomed to the drudgery of making cuts through woods, and drains in bogs, under continual blows and outrages. Such as are born to be slaves are but once sold, and thenceforward nourished by their lords. Britain is daily paying for its servitude, is daily feeding it. Moreover, as in a tribe of household slaves, he who comes last serves for sport to all his fellows; so in this ancient state of slavery to which the world is reduced, we, as the freshest slaves and thence held the most contemptible, are now designed to destruction. For, we have no fields to cultivate, nor mines to dig, nor ports to make; works for which they might be tempted to spare us alive: besides that ever distasteful to rulers is magnanimity and a daring spirit in their subjects. Indeed our very situation, so solitary and remote, the more security it affords to us, does but raise the greater jealousy in them. Seeing therefore you are thus bereft of all hopes of mercy, rouse now at last all your courage, both you to whom life is dearest, and you to whom glory. The Brigantes, even under the leading of a woman, burned their colony, stormed their entrenchments, and, had not such success degenerated into sloth, might have quite cast off the yoke of slavery. Let us who still preserve our forces entire, us who are still unsubdued, and want not to acquire liberty but only to secure it, manifest at once, upon the first encounter, what kind of men they are that Caledonia has reserved for her own vindication and defence.</p>
<p>"Do you indeed believe the Romans to be equally brave and vigorous in war, as during peace they are vicious and dissolute? From our quarrels and divisions it is that they have derived their renown, and thus convert the faults of their enemies to the glory of their own army; an army compounded of many nations so different, that as it is success alone which holds them together, misfortunes and disasters will surely dissolve them. Unless you suppose that the Germans there, that the Gauls, and many of the Britons (whom with shame I mention), men who however have been all much longer their enemies than their slaves, are yet attached to them by any real fidelity and affection, whilst presenting their blood to establish a domination altogether foreign and unnatural to them all. What restrains them is no more than awe and terror, frail bonds of endearment; and when these are removed, such who cease to fear, will immediately begin to manifest their hate. Amongst us is found whatever can stimulate men to victory. The Romans have no wives to hearten and to urge them. They have here no fathers and mothers to upbraid them for flying. Many of them have no country at all, or at least their country is elsewhere. But a few in number they are, ignorant of the region and thence struck with dread, whilst to their eyes, whatever they behold around them, is all wild and strange, even the air and sky, with the woods and the sea; so that the Gods have in some sort delivered them enclosed and bound into our hands.</p>
<p>"Be not dismayed with things of mere show, and with a glare of gold and of silver: this is what can neither wound, nor save. In the very host of the enemy we shall find bands of our own. The Britons will own and espouse their own genuine cause. The Gauls will recollect their former liberty. What the Usipians have lately done, the other Germans will do, and abandon the Romans. Thereafter nothing remains to be feared. Their forts are ungarrisoned; their colonies replenished with the aged and infirm; and between the people and their magistrates, whilst the former are averse to obedience, and the latter rule with injustice, the municipal cities are weakened and full of dissensions. Here you see a general, here an army: there you may behold tributes and the mines, with all the other train of calamities and curses ever pursuing men enslaved. Whether all these are to be for ever imposed, or whether we forthwith avenge ourselves for the attempt, this very field must determine. As therefore you advance to battle, look back upon your ancestors, look forward to your posterity."</p>
<p>They received his speech joyfully, with chantings, and terrible din, and many dissonant shouts, after the manner of barbarians. Already too their bands moved, and the glittering of their arms appeared, as all the most resolute were running to the front: moreover the army was forming in battle array; when Agricola; who indeed saw his soldiers full of alacrity, and hardly to be restrained even by express cautions, yet chose to discourse to them in the following strain. "It is now the eighth year, my fellow-soldiers, since through the virtue and auspicious fortune of the Roman Empire, and by your own services and fidelity you have been pursuing the conquest of Britain. In so many expeditions that you have undertaken, in so many battles as you have fought, you have still had constant occasion either to be exerting your bravery against the foe, or your patience and pains even against the obstacles of nature. Neither, during all these struggles, have we found any cause of mutual regret, I to have conducted such soldiers, or you to have followed such a captain. We have both passed the limits which we found, I those known to the ancient governors, you those of former armies; and we possess the very extremity of Britain, not only in the bruitings of fame and vulgar rumour, but possess it with our camps and arms. Britain is entirely discovered, and entirely subdued. In truth, as the army has been marching, whilst in passing morasses and mountains and rivers you have been fatigued and distressed, I was wont to hear every man remarkably brave ask, <i>When shall we see the enemy, when be led to battle?</i> Already they are come, roused from their fastnesses and lurking holes. Here you see the end of all your wishes, here scope for all your valour, and all things promising and propitious, if you conquer; but all cross and disastrous, should you be vanquished. For, as to have thus marched over a tract of country so immense, to have passed through gloomy forests, to have crossed arms of the deep, is matter of glory and applause whilst we advance against the enemy; so if we fly before them, whatever is now most in our favour, will then prove most to our peril. We know not the situation of the country so well as they know it; we have not provisions so abundant as they have: but we have limbs and arms; and in these, all things. For myself; it is a rule long since settled by me, that safety there is none either to the army or to the general, in turning their backs upon the foe. Hence it is not only more eligible to lose life honourably than to save it basely, but security and renown both arise from the same source. Neither would it be a fate void of glory to fall in this the utmost verge of earth and of nature.</p>
<p>"Were the people now arrayed against you such as were new to you, were you to engage with bands never before tried, I should animate you by the examples of other armies. At present, only recollect and enumerate your own signal exploits, only ask and consult your own eyes. These are they whom but the last year you utterly discomfited, only by the terror of your shouting, when, trusting to the darkness of the night, they by stealth attacked a single legion. These are they who of all the Britons are the most abandoned to fear and flight, and thence happen thus long to survive all the rest. It is with us as with those who make inroads into woods and forests. As beasts of the greatest strength there, are driven thence by the superior force of such as pursue them, and as the timorous and spiritless fly even at the cry of the pursuers: in like manner, all the bravest Britons are long since fallen by the sword. They that remain are only a crowd, fearful and effeminate: nor can you consider them as men whom you have therefore reached, because they have persisted to oppose you, but as such whom you have surprised as the last and forlorn of all, who struck with dread and bereft of spirit, stand benumbed in yonder field, whence you may gain over them a glorious and memorable victory. Here complete all your expeditions and efforts: here close a struggle of fifty years with one great and important day, so that to the army may not be imputed either the procrastination of the war, or any cause for reviving it."</p>
<p>Apparent, even whilst Agricola spoke, was the ardour of the soldiers, mighty their transport and applause at the end of his speech, and instantly they flew to their arms. Thus inflamed and urging to engage, he formed them so that the strong band of auxiliary foot, who were eight thousand men, composed the centre. The wings were environed with three thousand horse. The legions without advancing stood embattled just without the entrenchment; for that mighty would be the glory of the victory, were it, by sparing them, gained without spilling any Roman blood; and they were still a sure stay and succour, should the rest be repulsed. The British host was ranged upon the rising grounds, at once for show and terror, in such sort that the first band stood upon the plain, and the rest rose successively upon the brows of the hills, one rank close above another, as if they had been linked together. Their cavalry and chariots of war filled the interjacent field with great tumult and boundings to and fro. Agricola then, fearing from the surpassing multitude of the enemy, that he might be beset at once in the front and on each flank, opened and extended his host. Yet, though thence his ranks must prove more relaxed, and many advised him to bring on the legions, he, who rather entertained a spirit of hope, and in all difficulties was ever firm, dismissed his horse and advanced on foot before the banners.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the onset the conflict was maintained at a distance. The Britons, they who were possessed at once of bravery and skill, armed with their huge swords and small bucklers, quite eluded our missive weapons, or beat them quite off, whilst of their own they poured a torrent upon us, till Agricola encouraged three Batavian cohorts and two of the Tungrians, to close with the enemy and bring them to an engagement hand to hand; as what was with those veteran soldiers a long practice, and become familiar, but to the enemy very uneasy and embarrassing, as they were armed with very little targets and with swords of enormous size. For, the swords of the Britons, which are blunt at the end, are unfit for grapling and cannot support a close encounter. Hence the Batavians thickened their blows, wounded them with the iron bosses of their bucklers, mangled their faces, and, bearing down all who withstood them upon the plain, were already carrying the attack up to the hills: insomuch that the rest of the cohorts, incited by emulation and sudden ardour, joined with those and made havoc of all whom they encountered. Nay, such was the impetuosity and hurry of the victory, that many were left behind but half dead, others not so much as wounded. In the meantime their troops of cavalry took to flight: the chariots of war mingled with the battalions of foot; and though they had so lately struck terror, were now themselves beset and entangled with our thick bands, as also with the unevenness and intricacy of the place. Of a combat of cavalry this bore not the least appearance: since here, standing obstinately foot to foot, they pressed to overthrow each other by the weight and bodies of their horses. Moreover the war-chariots, now abandoned and straggling, as also the horses destitute of managers and thence wild and affrighted, were running hither and thither just as the next fright drove them; insomuch that all of their own side, who met them or crossed their way, were beaten down by them.</p>
<p>Now those of the Britons who were lodged upon the ridges of the hills and had hitherto no share in the encounter, like men yet pressed by no peril looked with scorn upon our forces as but few in number, and began to descend softly and to surround them in the rear, whilst they were urging their victory. But Agricola, who had apprehended this very design, despatched to engage them four squadrons of horse, such as he had reserved near him for the sudden exigencies of the field; and by this providence of his, the more furiously they had advanced, the more keenly were they repulsed and utterly routed. Thus against the Britons themselves their own devices were turned; and by the order of the General, the squadrons of cavalry which charged in front, wheeled about and assailed the enemy behind. Then in truth, all over the open fields was to be seen a spectacle prodigious and tragical, incessant pursuits, wounds and captivity, and the present captives always slaughtered, as often as others occurred to be taken. Now the enemy behaved just as they happened to be prompted by their several humours. Sometimes they fled in large troops with all their arms, before a smaller number that pursued them: others, quite unarmed, rushed into peril, and desperately presented themselves to instant death. On all sides lay scattered arms and carcasses, and mangled limbs, and the ground was dyed with blood. Nay, now and then even by the vanquished was exerted notable wrath and bravery. When once they drew near the woods, they rejoined and rallied, and thus circumvented the foremost pursuers, such as, without knowing the country, had rashly ventured too far. Whence we must have suffered some notable disaster, from such confidence void of caution, had not Agricola who was assiduously visiting every quarter, ordered the stoutest cohorts lightly equipped to range themselves in the form of a toil {Footnote: A net or web, to encompass them; such as Herodotus describes, for clearing out a vanquished enemy.} to invest them, also some of the cavalry to dismount, and enter the strait passes, and the rest of the horse, at the same time, to beat the more open and passable parts of the woods. Now, as soon as they perceived our forces to continue the pursuit with ranks regular and close, they betook themselves to open flight, in no united bands as before, no one man regarding or awaiting another; but quite scattered, and each shunning any companion, they all made to places far remote and desert. What ended the pursuit was night and a satiety of slaughter. Of the enemy were slain ten thousand. There fell of our men three hundred and forty, amongst these Aulus Atticus, commander of a cohort; one by his own youthful heart, as also by a fiery horse, hurried into the midst of the enemies.</p>
<p>It was indeed a night of great joy to the conquerors, both from victory and spoil. The Britons, who wandered in despair, men and women uttering in concert their dismal wailings, dragged along their wounded, called to such as were unhurt, deserted their houses, nay, in rage even set them on fire; made choice of lurking holes, then instantly forsook them; then met to consult, and from their counsels gathered some hope: sometimes, upon beholding their dearest pledges of nature, their spirits became utterly sunk and dejected; sometimes, by the same sight, they were roused into resolution and fury. Nay, 'tis very certain, that some murdered their children and wives, as an act of compassion and tenderness. The next day produced a more ample display of the victory; on all sides a profound silence, solitary hills, thick smoke rising from the houses on fire, and not a living soul to be found by the scouts. When from these, who had been despatched out every way, it was learnt, that whither the enemy had fled no certain traces could be discovered, and that they had nowhere rallied in bodies; when the summer was likewise passed and thence an impossibility of extending the operations of war, he conducted his army into the borders of the Horestians. After he had there received hostages, he ordered the Admiral of the Fleet to sail round Britain. For this expedition he was furnished with proper forces, and before him was already gone forth the terror of the Roman power: he himself the while led on his foot and horse with a slow pace, that thus the minds of these new nations might be awed and dismayed even by prolonging his march through them: he then lodged his army in garrisons for the winter. The fleet too having found a favourable sea, entered with great fame, into the harbour of Rhutupium: {Footnote: Supposed to be Sandwich Haven.} for, from thence it had sailed, and coasting along the nethermost shore of Britain, thither returned.</p>
<p>With this course and situation of things Agricola by letters acquainted the Emperor; tidings which, however modestly recounted, without all ostentation, or any pomp of words, Domitian received as with joy in his countenance, so with anguish in his soul: such was his custom. His heart indeed smote him for his late mock triumph over the Germans, which he knew to be held in public derision; as to adorn it he had purchased a number of slaves, who were so decked in their habits and hair, as to resemble captives in war. But here a victory mighty and certain, gained by the slaughter of so many thousands of the enemy, was universally sounded by the voice of fame, and received with vast applause. Terrible above all things it was to him, that the name of a private man should be exalted above that of the Prince. In vain had he driven from the public tribunals all pursuits of popular evidence and fame, in vain smothered the lustre of every civil accomplishment, if any other than himself possessed the glory of excelling in war: nay, however he might dissemble every other distaste, yet to the person of the Emperor properly appertained the virtue and praise of being a great General. Tortured with these anxious thoughts, and indulging his humour of being shut up in secret, a certain indication that he was fostering some sanguinary purpose, he at last judged it the best course, upon this occasion, to hide and reserve his rancour till the first flights of fame were passed, and the affection of the army cooled. For, Agricola held yet the administration of Britain.</p>
<p>To him therefore he caused to be decreed in Senate the triumphal ornaments, a statue crowned with laurel, with whatever else is bestowed instead of a real triumph, and heightened this his compliment with many expressions full of esteem and honour. He directed moreover a general expectation to be raised, that to Agricola was destined the Province of Syria, a Government then vacant by the death of Atilius Rufus, a man of Consular quality, since the same was reserved only for men of illustrious rank. Many there were who believed, that an Imperial freedman, one much trusted with the secret designs of his master, was by him despatched to carry the instrument appointing Agricola Governor of Syria, with orders to deliver it to him, were he still in Britain; that the freedman met Agricola crossing the Channel, and without once speaking to him, returned directly to Domitian. It is uncertain whether this account be true, or only a fiction framed in conformity to the character and genius of the Prince. To his successor, in the meantime, Agricola had surrendered the Province now settled in perfect peace and security. Moreover, to prevent all remarks upon the manner of his entry into Rome, from any popular distinction paid him, and any concourse of people to meet him, he utterly declined this observance of his friends, and came into the city by night; and by night, as he was directed, went to the palace. He was there received by the Emperor, with a short embrace, but without a word said; then passed, undistinguished, amongst the crowd of servile courtiers. Now in order to soften with other and different virtues the reputation of a military man, a name ever distasteful to those who live themselves in idleness, he resigned himself entirely to indolence and repose. In his dress he was modest; in his conversation courteous and free, and never found accompanied with more than one or two of his friends. Insomuch that many, such especially as are wont to judge of great men by their retinue and parade, all calculated to gain popular admiration, when they had beheld and observed Agricola, sought to know whence proceeded his mighty fame: there were indeed but few who could account for the motives of his conduct.</p>
<p>Frequently, during the course of that time, was he accused in his absence before Domitian, and in his absence also acquitted. What threatened his life was no crime of his, nor complaint of any particular for injuries received, nor aught else save the glorious character of the man, and the spirit of the Emperor hating all excellence and every virtue. With these causes there concurred the most mischievous sort of all enemies, they who extolled him in order to destroy him. Moreover in the Commonwealth there ensued such times as would not permit the name of Agricola to remain unmentioned: so many were the armies which we had lost in Moesia, in Dacia, in Germany, in Pannonia; all by the wretched conduct of our Generals, either altogether impotent or foolhardy: so many withal were the brave officers, with so many bands of men overthrown and taken. Neither was the question and contest now about maintaining the limits of the Empire and guarding the rivers which served for its boundaries, but about defending the standing encampments of the legions and preserving our own territories. Thus, when public misfortunes were following one another in a continual train, when every year was become signal for calamities and slaughters, Agricola was by the common voice of the populace required for the command of our armies. For, all men were comparing his vigour, his firmness, and his mind trained in war, with the sloth and timidity of the others. With discourses of this strain, it is certain that even the ears of Domitian himself were teased; whilst all the best of his freedmen advised and pressed him to this choice, out of pure affection and duty, as did the worst out of virulence and envy; and to whatever appeared most malignant that Prince was ever prone. In this manner was Agricola, as well through his own virtues as through the base management of others, pushed upon a precipice even of glory.</p>
<p>A.D. 90. The year was now arrived when to the lot of Agricola was to fall the Proconsulship of Asia or of Africa: and, as Civica had been lately murdered (even whilst Proconsul of the former Province), Agricola was neither unprepared what course to pursue, nor Domitian unfurnished with an example to follow. It happened too, that certain persons, men apprised of the secret purposes of the Prince, made it their business to accost Agricola and ask him, whether he meant in earnest to take possession of his Province. Nay, they began, at first indeed with some reserve, to extol a life of tranquillity and repose; anon they proffered their good offices to procure his demission and excuse: at last, throwing off all disguise, and proceeding at once to dissuade and to intimidate him, they prevailed with him to be carried, with this as his suit, to Domitian. He, already prepared to dissemble his sentiments, and assuming a mien of haughtiness, not only received the petition of Agricola to be excused, but when he had granted it, suffered himself to be presented with formal thanks, Nor was he ashamed of conferring a grace so unpopular and odious. To Agricola however he gave not the salary which was wont to be paid to Proconsuls, and which he himself had continued to some. Whether he were affronted that it was not asked, or whether restrained by his own guilty mind, lest he might seem to have purchased with money what he had hindered by his interposition and power. It is the nature of men, that whomsoever they injure they hate. Now Domitian was in his temper apt to be suddenly transported into rage, and, in proportion as he smothered his vengeance, the more irreconcilable he always certainly proved. Yet by the prudence and moderation of Agricola, he was softened. For, by no contumacy of his, nor by any vain ostentation of a spirit of liberty ill-timed, did he court fame or urge his fate. Let such who are wont to admire things daring and forbidden, know, that even under evil Princes great men may be produced, and that by the means of modesty and observance, provided these be accompanied with application and vigour, they may rise to an equal measure of public estimation and praise with that of many, who through a conduct very stubborn and precipitate, but of no advantage to the Commonweal, have distinguished themselves by dying only to gain a great name.</p>
<p>A.D. 93. Afflicting to us his family proved the end of his life, sorrowful to his friends; and even to foreigners and such as knew him not, matter of trouble and condolence. The commonalty likewise, and such people as were void of employment, {Footnote: Or it may be thus translated: "The body of the people though chiefly intent upon such affairs as concerned not the State."—GORDON. Burnouf is better: "Ce peuple, qu'occupent d'autres intérêts."} were not only frequent in their visits to his house, but in all public places, in all particular companies made him the subject of their conversation. Nor, when his death was divulged, was there a soul found who either rejoiced at it, or presently forgot it. What heightened the public commiseration and concern, was a prevailing rumour that he was despatched by poison. That there was any proof of this, I dare not aver. Yet it is true, that during the whole course of his illness, Domitian caused frequent visits to be made him, indeed much more frequent than Princes are wont to make, both by his favourite freedmen and most trusty physicians; whether through real concern for his health, or solicitude to learn the probability of his death. It is well known that on the day in which he expired, continual accounts were, by messengers purposely placed, every instant transmitted to the Emperor, how fast his end was approaching; and no one believed, that he would thus quicken such tidings, had he been to feel any sorrow from hearing them. In his face however and even in his spirit, he affected to show some guise of grief; for, he was now secure against the object of his hate, and could more easily dissemble his present joy, than lately his fear. It was abundantly notorious how much it rejoiced him, upon reading the last will of Agricola, to find himself left joint heir with his excellent wife and tender daughter. This he took to have been done out of judgment and choice, and in pure honour to himself. So blind and corrupt was his mind rendered by continual flattery, as not to know, that to no Prince but a bad one will any good father bequeath his fortune.</p>
<p>Agricola was born on the 13th of June, during the third Consulship of the Emperor Caligula. He died on the 24th of August, during the Consulship of Collega and Priscus, in the fifty-sixth year of his age. If posterity be desirous to know his make and stature; in his person he was rather genteel and regular than tall. {Footnote: Decentior quam sublimior fuit.} In his aspect there was nothing terrible. His looks were extremely graceful and pleasing. A good man you would have readily believed him, and been glad to have found that he was a great man. Nay, though he was snatched away whilst his age was yet in full vigour, if however his life be measured by his glory, he attained to a mighty length of days. For, every true felicity and acquisition, namely, all such as arise from virtue, he had already enjoyed to the full. As he had been likewise dignified with the Consular and triumphal honours, what more could fortune add to his lustre and renown? After enormous wealth he sought not: an honourable share he possessed. As behind him he left surviving his daughter and his wife, he may be even accounted happy; since by dying whilst his credit was nowise impaired, his fame in its full splendour, his relations and friends yet in a state of security, he escaped the evils to come. For, as before us he was wont to express his wishes, that he might survive to see this truly blessed Age, and Trajan swaying the sovereignty, wishes which he uttered with presages as of what would surely ensue; so it was a wondrous consolation attending the quickness of his death, that thence he evaded the misery of the latter times, when Domitian, who had ceased to exert his tyranny by starts only and intermissions, was come now to rend the Commonwealth by cruelties without all respite, and to overthrow it as it were by one great and deadly stroke.</p>
<p>For, Agricola saw not the Court of the Senate besieged, nor the Senate enclosed by armed men, nor the butchery of so many men of Consular dignity, nor the flight and exile of so many ladies of the prime nobility, all effected in one continued havoc. Till then Carus Metius, the accuser, was only considerable for having been victorious in one bloody process; till then the cruel motions of Messallinus rang only within the palace at Alba; {Footnote: A country palace of Domitian.} and in those days Massa Bebius (afterwards so exercised in arraigning the innocent) was himself arraigned as a criminal. Presently after we, with our own hands, dragged Helvidius to prison and execution: we beheld the melancholy doom of Mauricus and Rusticus: we found ourselves besprinkled with the innocent blood of Senecio. Even Nero withheld his eyes from scenes of cruelty, he indeed ordered murders to be perpetrated, but saw not the perpetration. The principal part of our miseries under Domitian, was to be obliged to see him and be seen by him, at a time when all our sighs and sorrows were watched and marked down for condemnation; when that cruel countenance of his, always covered with a settled red, whence he hardened himself against all shame and blushing, served him to mark and recount all the pale horrors at once possessing so many men. Thou therefore, Agricola, art happy, not only as thy life was glorious, but as thy death was seasonable. According to the account of such who heard thy last words, thou didst accept thy fate cheerfully and with firmness, as if thou thus didst thy part to show the Emperor to be guiltless. But to myself and thy daughter, besides the anguish of having our father snatched from us, it proves a fresh accession of sorrow, that we had not an opportunity to attend thee in thy sickness, to solace thy sinking spirits, to please ourselves with seeing thee, please ourselves with embracing thee. Doubtless, we should have greedily received thy instructions and sayings, and engraved them for ever upon our hearts. This is our woe, this a wound to our spirit, that by the lot of long absence from thee thou wast already lost to us for four years before thy death. There is no question, excellent father, but that with whatever thy condition required thou wast honourably supplied, as thou wast attended by thy wife, one so full of tenderness for her husband: yet fewer tears accompanied thy course, and during thy last moments somewhat was wanting to satisfy thine eyes.</p>
<p>If for the <i>Manes</i> of the just any place be found; if, as philosophers hold, great spirits perish not with the body, pleasing be thy repose. Moreover, recall us thy family from this our weakness in regretting thee, and from these our effeminate wailings, to the contemplation of thy virtues, for which it were unjust to lament or to mourn. Let us rather adorn thy memory with deathless praises and (as far as our infirmities will allow) by pursuing and adopting thy excellencies. This is true honour, this the natural duty incumbent upon every near relation. This is also what I would recommend to thy daughter and thy wife, so to reverence the memory of a father, and a husband, as to be ever ruminating upon all his doings, upon all his sayings, and rather to adore his immortal name, rather the image of his mind than that of his person. Not that I mean to condemn the use of statues, such as are framed of marble or brass. But as the persons of men are frail and perishing, so are likewise the portraitures of men. The form of the soul is eternal, such as you cannot represent and preserve by the craft of hands or by materials foreign to its nature, nor otherwise than by a similitude and conformity of manners. Whatever we loved in Agricola, whatever we admired, remains, and will for ever remain implanted in the hearts of men, through an eternity of ages, and conveyed down in the voice of fame, in the record of things. For, many of the great ancients, by being buried in oblivion, have thence reaped the fate of men altogether mean and inglorious: but Agricola shall ever survive in his history here composed and transmitted to posterity.</p>

<br/>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no

<br/>(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
<br/>permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
<br/>set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
<br/>copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
<br/>protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
<br/>Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
<br/>charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
<br/>do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
<br/>rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
<br/>such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
<br/>research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

<br/>
<br/>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
<br/>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
<br/>
<br/>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
<br/>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
<br/>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
<br/>Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
<br/>  www.gutenberg.org/license.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic works
<br/>
<br/>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
<br/>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
<br/>(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
<br/>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
<br/>all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
<br/>If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
<br/>terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
<br/>entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
<br/>
<br/>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
<br/>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
<br/>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
<br/>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
<br/>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
<br/>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
<br/>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
<br/>
<br/>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
<br/>or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
<br/>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
<br/>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
<br/>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
<br/>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
<br/>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
<br/>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
<br/>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
<br/>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
<br/>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
<br/>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
<br/>
<br/>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
<br/>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
<br/>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
<br/>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
<br/>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
<br/>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
<br/>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
<br/>States.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
<br/>
<br/>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
<br/>access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
<br/>whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
<br/>phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
<br/>Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
<br/>copied or distributed:
<br/>
<br/>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
<br/>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
<br/>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
<br/>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
<br/>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
<br/>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
<br/>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
<br/>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
<br/>with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
<br/>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
<br/>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
<br/>1.E.9.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
<br/>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
<br/>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
<br/>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
<br/>to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
<br/>permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
<br/>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
<br/>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
<br/>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
<br/>active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm License.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
<br/>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
<br/>word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
<br/>distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
<br/>"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
<br/>posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
<br/>you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
<br/>copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
<br/>request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
<br/>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
<br/>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
<br/>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
<br/>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
<br/>that
<br/>
<br/>- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
<br/>     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
<br/>     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
<br/>     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
<br/>     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
<br/>     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
<br/>     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
<br/>     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
<br/>     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
<br/>     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
<br/>     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
<br/>     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
<br/>
<br/>- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
<br/>     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
<br/>     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>     License.  You must require such a user to return or
<br/>     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
<br/>     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
<br/>     Project Gutenberg-tm works.
<br/>
<br/>- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
<br/>     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
<br/>     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
<br/>     of receipt of the work.
<br/>
<br/>- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
<br/>     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
<br/>forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
<br/>both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
<br/>Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
<br/>Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
<br/>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
<br/>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
<br/>"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
<br/>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
<br/>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
<br/>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
<br/>your equipment.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
<br/>of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
<br/>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
<br/>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
<br/>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
<br/>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
<br/>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
<br/>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
<br/>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br/>DAMAGE.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
<br/>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
<br/>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
<br/>written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
<br/>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
<br/>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
<br/>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
<br/>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
<br/>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
<br/>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
<br/>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
<br/>opportunities to fix the problem.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
<br/>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
<br/>WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
<br/>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
<br/>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
<br/>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
<br/>law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
<br/>interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
<br/>the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
<br/>provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
<br/>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
<br/>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
<br/>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
<br/>promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
<br/>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
<br/>that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
<br/>or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
<br/>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
<br/>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
<br/>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
<br/>people in all walks of life.
<br/>
<br/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
<br/>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
<br/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
<br/>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
<br/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
<br/>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
<br/>and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
<br/>Foundation
<br/>
<br/>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
<br/>501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
<br/>state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
<br/>Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
<br/>number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
<br/>Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
<br/>permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.
<br/>
<br/>The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.
<br/>Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
<br/>throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809
<br/>North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email

<br/>     gbnewby@pglaf.org
<br/>
<br/>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
<br/>Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
<br/>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
<br/>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
<br/>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
<br/>array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
<br/>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
<br/>status with the IRS.
<br/>
<br/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
<br/>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
<br/>States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
<br/>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
<br/>with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
<br/>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<br/>SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
<br/>particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
<br/>
<br/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
<br/>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
<br/>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
<br/>approach us with offers to donate.
<br/>
<br/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
<br/>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
<br/>outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
<br/>
<br/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
<br/>methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
<br/>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
<br/>To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works.
<br/>
<br/>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
<br/>with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
<br/>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
<br/>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
<br/>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
<br/>
<br/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<br/>
<br/>     www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
<br/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
<br/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
<br/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
