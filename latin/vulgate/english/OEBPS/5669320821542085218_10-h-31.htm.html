<p>4:39 And they went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.</p>
<p>4:40 And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt there of old.</p>
<p>4:41 And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and dwelt in their rooms: because there was pasture there for their flocks.</p>
<p>4:42 And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.</p>
<p>4:43 And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped, and dwelt there unto this day.</p>
<p>5:1 Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but forasmuch as he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.</p>
<p>5:2 For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph’s:) 5:3 The sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were, Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.</p>
<p>5:4 The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son, 5:5 Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son, 5:6 Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.</p>
<p>5:7 And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah, 5:8 And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon: 5:9 And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.</p>
<p>5:10 And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east land of Gilead.</p>
<p>5:11 And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan unto Salcah: 5:12 Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.</p>
<p>5:13 And their brethren of the house of their fathers were, Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, seven.</p>
<p>5:14 These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz; 5:15 Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their fathers.</p>
<p>5:16 And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.</p>
<p>5:17 All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.</p>
<p>5:18 The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the war.</p>
<p>5:19 And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab.</p>
<p>5:20 And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him.</p>
<p>5:21 And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.</p>
<p>5:22 For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.</p>
<p>5:23 And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon.</p>
<p>5:24 And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and heads of the house of their fathers.</p>
<p>5:25 And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them.</p>
<p>5:26 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.</p>

<p>9:1 So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.</p>
<p>9:2 Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.</p>
<p>9:3 And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh; 9:4 Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah.</p>

<p>9:14 And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari; 9:15 And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph; 9:16 And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.</p>
<p>9:17 And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief; 9:18 Who hitherto waited in the king’s gate eastward: they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi.</p>
<p>9:19 And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.</p>
<p>9:20 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, and the LORD was with him.</p>
<p>9:21 And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p>9:22 All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office.</p>
<p>9:23 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards.</p>
<p>9:24 In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.</p>
<p>9:25 And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them.</p>
<p>9:26 For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.</p>
<p>9:27 And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them.</p>
<p>9:28 And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale.</p>
<p>9:29 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.</p>
<p>9:30 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.</p>
<p>9:31 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans.</p>
<p>9:32 And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath.</p>
<p>9:33 And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that work day and night.</p>
<p>9:34 These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>9:35 And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife’s name was Maachah: 9:36 And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab.</p>
<p>9:37 And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.</p>
<p>9:38 And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.</p>
<p>9:39 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.</p>
<p>9:40 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat Micah.</p>
<p>9:41 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and Ahaz.</p>
<p>9:42 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza; 9:43 And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.</p>
<p>9:44 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons of Azel.</p>
<p>10:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p>10:2 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</p>
<p>10:3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.</p>
<p>10:4 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</p>
<p>10:5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.</p>
<p>10:6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.</p>
<p>10:7 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</p>
<p>10:8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p>10:9 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.</p>
<p>10:10 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.</p>
<p>10:11 And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 10:12 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</p>
<p>10:13 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it; 10:14 And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.</p>
<p>11:1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</p>
<p>11:2 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</p>
<p>11:3 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.</p>
<p>11:4 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.</p>
<p>11:5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.</p>
<p>11:6 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</p>
<p>11:7 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</p>
<p>11:8 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</p>
<p>11:9 So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him.</p>
<p>11:10 These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</p>
<p>11:11 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.</p>
<p>11:12 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.</p>
<p>11:13 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</p>
<p>11:14 And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.</p>
<p>11:15 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p>11:16 And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison was then at Bethlehem.</p>
<p>11:17 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate! 11:18 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.</p>
<p>11:19 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it.</p>
<p>These things did these three mightiest.</p>
<p>11:20 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.</p>
<p>11:21 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.</p>
<p>11:22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</p>
<p>11:23 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.</p>
<p>11:24 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.</p>
<p>11:25 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.</p>
<p>11:26 Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 11:27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 11:28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite, 11:29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 11:30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, 11:31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 11:32 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 11:33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 11:34 The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite, 11:35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 11:36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 11:37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, 11:38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri, 11:39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 11:40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 11:41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 11:42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him, 11:43 Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, 11:44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite, 11:45 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, 11:46 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite, 11:47 Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.</p>
<p>12:1 Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.</p>
<p>12:2 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul’s brethren of Benjamin.</p>
<p>12:3 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.</p>
<p>12:4 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite, 12:5 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite, 12:6 Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites, 12:7 And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.</p>
<p>12:8 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains; 12:9 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 12:10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 12:11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 12:12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 12:13 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.</p>
<p>12:14 These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.</p>
<p>12:15 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.</p>
<p>12:16 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.</p>
<p>12:17 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.</p>
<p>12:18 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee.</p>
<p>Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.</p>
<p>12:19 And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.</p>
<p>12:20 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.</p>
<p>12:21 And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.</p>
<p>12:22 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.</p>
<p>12:23 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p>12:24 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.</p>
<p>12:25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.</p>
<p>12:26 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p>12:27 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred; 12:28 And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father’s house twenty and two captains.</p>
<p>12:29 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.</p>
<p>12:30 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.</p>
<p>12:31 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.</p>
<p>12:32 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.</p>
<p>12:33 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart.</p>
<p>12:34 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.</p>
<p>12:35 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p>12:36 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.</p>
<p>12:37 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.</p>
<p>12:38 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.</p>
<p>12:39 And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.</p>
<p>12:40 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.</p>
<p>13:1 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.</p>
<p>13:2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us: 13:3 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.</p>
<p>13:4 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</p>
<p>13:5 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.</p>
<p>13:6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.</p>
<p>13:7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.</p>
<p>13:8 And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</p>
<p>13:9 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</p>
<p>13:10 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.</p>
<p>13:11 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.</p>
<p>13:12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me? 13:13 So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</p>
<p>13:14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.</p>
<p>14:1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.</p>
<p>14:2 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.</p>
<p>14:3 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.</p>
<p>14:4 Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 14:5 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, 14:6 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 14:7 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.</p>
<p>14:8 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them.</p>
<p>14:9 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p>14:10 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.</p>
<p>14:11 So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.</p>
<p>14:12 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.</p>
<p>14:13 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.</p>
<p>14:14 Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</p>
<p>14:15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</p>
<p>14:16 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.</p>
<p>14:17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.</p>
<p>15:1 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</p>
<p>15:2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.</p>
<p>15:3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.</p>
<p>15:4 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 15:5 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: 15:6 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: 15:7 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty: 15:8 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: 15:9 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: 15:10 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.</p>
<p>15:11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, 15:12 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.</p>
<p>15:13 For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.</p>
<p>15:14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p>15:15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p>15:16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.</p>
<p>15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 15:18 And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.</p>
<p>15:19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass; 15:20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; 15:21 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.</p>
<p>15:22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.</p>
<p>15:23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.</p>
<p>15:24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.</p>
<p>15:25 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.</p>
<p>15:26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.</p>
<p>15:27 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.</p>
<p>15:28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.</p>
<p>15:29 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.</p>
<p>16:1 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.</p>
<p>16:2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>16:3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.</p>
<p>16:4 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: 16:5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; 16:6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p>16:7 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</p>
<p>16:8 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.</p>
<p>16:9 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>
<p>16:10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</p>
<p>16:11 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.</p>
<p>16:12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 16:13 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</p>
<p>16:14 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</p>
