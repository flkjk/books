<p>105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</p>
<p>105:26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.</p>
<p>105:27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</p>
<p>105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</p>
<p>105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</p>
<p>105:30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</p>
<p>105:31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.</p>
<p>105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.</p>
<p>105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</p>
<p>105:34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</p>
<p>105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</p>
<p>105:36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</p>
<p>105:37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.</p>
<p>105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</p>
<p>105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</p>
<p>105:40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</p>
<p>105:41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.</p>
<p>105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.</p>
<p>105:43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:</p>
<p>105:44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</p>
<p>105:45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?</p>
<p>106:3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.</p>
<p>106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</p>
<p>106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</p>
<p>106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</p>
<p>106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.</p>
<p>106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</p>
<p>106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>
<p>106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
<p>106:11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</p>
<p>106:12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</p>
<p>106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</p>
<p>106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</p>
<p>106:15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</p>
<p>106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.</p>
<p>106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.</p>
<p>106:18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</p>
<p>106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</p>
<p>106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</p>
<p>106:21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</p>
<p>106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.</p>
<p>106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</p>
<p>106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</p>
<p>106:25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</p>
<p>106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</p>
<p>106:27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</p>
<p>106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
<p>106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</p>
<p>106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</p>
<p>106:31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</p>
<p>106:32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>
<p>106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</p>
<p>106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</p>
<p>106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</p>
<p>106:36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>
<p>106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>
<p>106:38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</p>
<p>106:39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>
<p>106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>
<p>106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>
<p>106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
<p>106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>
<p>106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</p>
<p>106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p>106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</p>
<p>106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</p>
<p>106:48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</p>
<p>107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</p>
<p>107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</p>
<p>107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>
<p>107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>
<p>107:8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p>107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</p>
<p>107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;</p>
<p>107:11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</p>
<p>107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.</p>
<p>107:13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</p>
<p>107:15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p>107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</p>
<p>107:17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</p>
<p>107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</p>
<p>107:19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</p>
<p>107:21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p>107:22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</p>
<p>107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</p>
<p>107:24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</p>
<p>107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</p>
<p>107:26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>
<p>107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end.</p>
<p>107:28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>107:29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</p>
<p>107:30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</p>
<p>107:31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p>107:32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>
<p>107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</p>
<p>107:34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
<p>107:35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</p>
<p>107:36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</p>
<p>107:37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</p>
<p>107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</p>
<p>107:39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>
<p>107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.</p>
<p>107:41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.</p>
<p>107:42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</p>
<p>107:43 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</p>
<p>108:1 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.</p>
<p>108:2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.</p>
<p>108:3 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.</p>
<p>108:4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.</p>
<p>108:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;</p>
<p>108:6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.</p>
<p>108:7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</p>
<p>108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;</p>
<p>108:9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.</p>
<p>108:10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?</p>
<p>108:11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?</p>
<p>108:12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.</p>
<p>108:13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.</p>
<p>109:1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</p>
<p>109:2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</p>
<p>109:3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</p>
<p>109:4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.</p>
<p>109:5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</p>
<p>109:6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</p>
<p>109:7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</p>
<p>109:8 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.</p>
<p>109:9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>
<p>109:10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.</p>
<p>109:11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</p>
<p>109:12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</p>
<p>109:13 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</p>
<p>109:14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>
<p>109:15 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</p>
<p>109:16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</p>
<p>109:17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</p>
<p>109:18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</p>
<p>109:19 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</p>
<p>109:20 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</p>
<p>109:21 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.</p>
<p>109:22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</p>
<p>109:23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</p>
<p>109:24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</p>
<p>109:25 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</p>
<p>109:26 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</p>
<p>109:27 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.</p>
<p>109:28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</p>
<p>109:29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</p>
<p>109:30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</p>
<p>109:31 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.</p>
<p>110:1 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>
<p>110:2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.</p>
<p>110:3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.</p>
<p>110:4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>110:5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.</p>
<p>110:6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.</p>
<p>110:7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.</p>
<p>111:1 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.</p>
<p>111:2 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.</p>
<p>111:3 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.</p>
<p>111:4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.</p>
<p>111:5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.</p>
<p>111:6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.</p>
<p>111:7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.</p>
<p>111:8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.</p>
<p>111:9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.</p>
<p>111:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.</p>
<p>112:1 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.</p>
<p>112:2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.</p>
<p>112:3 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.</p>
<p>112:4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.</p>
<p>112:5 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.</p>
<p>112:6 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.</p>
<p>112:7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.</p>
<p>112:8 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.</p>
<p>112:9 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.</p>
<p>112:10 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.</p>
<p>113:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>113:2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.</p>
<p>113:3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD’s name is to be praised.</p>
<p>113:4 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.</p>
<p>113:5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,</p>
<p>113:6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!</p>
<p>113:7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;</p>
<p>113:8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.</p>
<p>113:9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>114:1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;</p>
<p>114:2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.</p>
<p>114:3 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.</p>
<p>114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.</p>
<p>114:5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?</p>
<p>114:6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?</p>
<p>114:7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;</p>
<p>114:8 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.</p>
<p>115:1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake.</p>
<p>115:2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?</p>
<p>115:3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.</p>
<p>115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.</p>
<p>115:5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:</p>
<p>115:6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:</p>
<p>115:7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.</p>
<p>115:8 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.</p>
<p>115:9 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.</p>
<p>115:10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.</p>
<p>115:11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.</p>
<p>115:12 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.</p>
<p>115:13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.</p>
<p>115:14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.</p>
<p>115:15 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.</p>
<p>115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD’s: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.</p>
<p>115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.</p>
<p>115:18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.</p>
<p>Praise the LORD.</p>
<p>116:1 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.</p>
<p>116:2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</p>
<p>116:3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.</p>
<p>116:4 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.</p>
<p>116:5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.</p>
<p>116:6 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.</p>
<p>116:7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.</p>
<p>116:8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.</p>
<p>116:9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.</p>
<p>116:10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:</p>
<p>116:11 I said in my haste, All men are liars.</p>
<p>116:12 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?</p>
<p>116:13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>116:14 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.</p>
<p>116:15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.</p>
<p>116:16 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.</p>
<p>116:17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>116:18 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.</p>
<p>116:19 In the courts of the LORD’s house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>117:1 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.</p>
<p>117:2 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>118:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>118:2 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>118:4 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>118:5 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.</p>
<p>118:6 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?</p>
<p>118:7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.</p>
<p>118:8 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.</p>
<p>118:9 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.</p>
<p>118:10 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.</p>
<p>118:11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>
<p>118:12 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>
<p>118:13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.</p>
<p>118:14 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.</p>
<p>118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.</p>
<p>118:16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.</p>
<p>118:17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.</p>
<p>118:18 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.</p>
<p>118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:</p>
<p>118:20 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.</p>
<p>118:21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.</p>
<p>118:22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.</p>
<p>118:23 This is the LORD’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.</p>
<p>118:24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.</p>
<p>118:25 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.</p>
<p>118:26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>118:27 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.</p>
<p>118:28 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.</p>
<p>118:29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>119:1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.</p>
<p>119:2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.</p>
<p>119:3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.</p>
<p>119:4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.</p>
<p>119:5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!</p>
<p>119:6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p>119:8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.</p>
<p>119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.</p>
<p>119:12 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.</p>
<p>119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.</p>
<p>119:15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.</p>
<p>119:16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.</p>
<p>119:17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.</p>
<p>119:18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</p>
<p>119:19 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.</p>
<p>119:20 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.</p>
<p>119:21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:22 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:23 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:24 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.</p>
<p>119:25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:26 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.</p>
<p>119:28 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.</p>
<p>119:29 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.</p>
<p>119:30 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.</p>
<p>119:31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.</p>
<p>119:32 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.</p>
<p>119:33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.</p>
<p>119:34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.</p>
<p>119:35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.</p>
<p>119:36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.</p>
<p>119:37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.</p>
<p>119:38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.</p>
<p>119:39 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.</p>
<p>119:40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.</p>
<p>119:41 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.</p>
<p>119:43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.</p>
<p>119:44 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.</p>
<p>119:45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.</p>
<p>119:47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.</p>
<p>119:48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:49 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.</p>
<p>119:50 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.</p>
<p>119:51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.</p>
<p>119:52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.</p>
<p>119:53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.</p>
<p>119:54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.</p>
<p>119:55 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.</p>
<p>119:56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:57 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.</p>
<p>119:58 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.</p>
<p>119:62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p>119:63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.</p>
<p>119:66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.</p>
<p>119:68 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:69 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.</p>
<p>119:70 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.</p>
<p>119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.</p>
<p>119:73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.</p>
<p>119:75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.</p>
<p>119:76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.</p>
<p>119:77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.</p>
<p>119:78 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.</p>
<p>119:81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.</p>
<p>119:82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?</p>
<p>119:83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:84 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?</p>
<p>119:85 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.</p>
<p>119:86 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.</p>
<p>119:87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.</p>
<p>119:89 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.</p>
<p>119:90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.</p>
<p>119:91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.</p>
<p>119:92 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.</p>
<p>119:93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.</p>
<p>119:94 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:96 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.</p>
<p>119:97 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.</p>
<p>119:98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.</p>
<p>119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.</p>
<p>119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.</p>
<p>119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.</p>
<p>119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!</p>
<p>119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.</p>
<p>119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</p>
<p>119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p>119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.</p>
<p>119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.</p>
<p>119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.</p>
<p>119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.</p>
<p>119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.</p>
<p>119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.</p>
<p>119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.</p>
<p>119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.</p>
<p>119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.</p>
<p>119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.</p>
<p>119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.</p>
<p>119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.</p>
<p>119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.</p>
<p>119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.</p>
<p>119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.</p>
<p>119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.</p>
<p>119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.</p>
<p>119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.</p>
<p>119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.</p>
<p>119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.</p>
<p>119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.</p>
<p>119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.</p>
<p>119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.</p>
<p>119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.</p>
<p>119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.</p>
<p>119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.</p>
<p>119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.</p>
<p>119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.</p>
<p>119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.</p>
<p>119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.</p>
<p>119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.</p>
<p>119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.</p>
<p>119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.</p>
<p>119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.</p>
<p>119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.</p>
<p>119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.</p>
<p>119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.</p>
<p>119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.</p>
<p>119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.</p>
<p>119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.</p>
<p>119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.</p>
<p>119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.</p>
<p>119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.</p>
<p>119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.</p>
<p>119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p>119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.</p>
<p>119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.</p>
<p>119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.</p>
<p>119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.</p>
<p>119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight.</p>
<p>119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.</p>
<p>119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.</p>
<p>120:1 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.</p>
<p>120:2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.</p>
<p>120:3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?</p>
<p>120:4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.</p>
<p>120:5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!</p>
<p>120:6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.</p>
<p>120:7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.</p>
<p>121:1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.</p>
<p>121:2 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.</p>
<p>121:3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.</p>
<p>121:4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.</p>
<p>121:5 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.</p>
<p>121:6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.</p>
<p>121:7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.</p>
<p>121:8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.</p>
<p>122:1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>122:2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.</p>
<p>122:3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:</p>
<p>122:4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>122:5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.</p>
<p>122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.</p>
<p>122:7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.</p>
<p>122:8 For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.</p>
<p>122:9 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.</p>
<p>123:1 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.</p>
<p>123:2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.</p>
<p>123:3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.</p>
<p>123:4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.</p>
<p>124:1 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;</p>
<p>124:2 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:</p>
<p>124:3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:</p>
<p>124:4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:</p>
<p>124:5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.</p>
<p>124:6 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.</p>
<p>124:7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.</p>
<p>124:8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.</p>
<p>125:1 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.</p>
<p>125:2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.</p>
<p>125:3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.</p>
<p>125:4 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.</p>
<p>125:5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.</p>
<p>126:1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.</p>
<p>126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.</p>
<p>126:3 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.</p>
<p>126:4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.</p>
<p>126:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</p>
<p>126:6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.</p>
<p>127:1 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.</p>
<p>127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.</p>
<p>127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.</p>
<p>127:4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.</p>
<p>127:5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.</p>
<p>128:1 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.</p>
<p>128:2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.</p>
<p>128:3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.</p>
<p>128:4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.</p>
<p>128:5 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.</p>
<p>128:6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children, and peace upon Israel.</p>
<p>129:1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:</p>
<p>129:2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.</p>
<p>129:3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.</p>
<p>129:4 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.</p>
<p>129:5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.</p>
<p>129:6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:</p>
<p>129:7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.</p>
<p>129:8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>130:1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.</p>
<p>130:2 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.</p>
<p>130:3 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?</p>
<p>130:4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</p>
<p>130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.</p>
<p>130:6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.</p>
<p>130:7 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.</p>
<p>130:8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.</p>
<p>131:1 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.</p>
<p>131:2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.</p>
<p>131:3 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.</p>
<p>132:1 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:</p>
<p>132:2 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;</p>
<p>132:3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;</p>
<p>132:4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,</p>
<p>132:5 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.</p>
<p>132:6 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.</p>
<p>132:7 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.</p>
<p>132:8 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.</p>
<p>132:9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.</p>
<p>132:10 For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.</p>
<p>132:11 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.</p>
<p>132:12 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.</p>
<p>132:13 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.</p>
<p>132:14 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.</p>
<p>132:15 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p>
<p>132:16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</p>
<p>132:17 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.</p>
<p>132:18 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.</p>
<p>133:1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!</p>
<p>133:2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;</p>
<p>133:3 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.</p>
<p>134:1 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>134:2 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.</p>
<p>134:3 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.</p>
<p>135:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.</p>
<p>135:2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.</p>
<p>135:3 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.</p>
<p>135:4 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.</p>
<p>135:5 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.</p>
<p>135:6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.</p>
<p>135:7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.</p>
<p>135:8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.</p>
<p>135:9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.</p>
<p>135:10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;</p>
<p>135:11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:</p>
<p>135:12 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.</p>
<p>135:13 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.</p>
<p>135:14 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.</p>
<p>135:15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.</p>
<p>135:16 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;</p>
<p>135:17 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.</p>
<p>135:18 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.</p>
<p>135:19 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:</p>
<p>135:20 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.</p>
<p>135:21 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>136:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:2 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:3 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:4 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:5 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:6 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:7 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:8 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:9 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:10 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:11 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:12 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:13 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:14 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:15 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:16 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:17 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:18 And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:19 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:20 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:21 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:22 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:23 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:24 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:25 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:26 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>137:1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.</p>
<p>137:2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.</p>
<p>137:3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.</p>
<p>137:4 How shall we sing the LORD’s song in a strange land?</p>
<p>137:5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.</p>
<p>137:6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.</p>
<p>137:7 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.</p>
<p>137:8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.</p>
<p>137:9 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.</p>
<p>138:1 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.</p>
<p>138:2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.</p>
<p>138:3 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.</p>
<p>138:4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.</p>
<p>138:5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD.</p>
<p>138:6 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.</p>
<p>138:7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.</p>
<p>138:8 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.</p>
<p>139:1 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.</p>
<p>139:2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.</p>
<p>139:3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</p>
<p>139:4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.</p>
<p>139:5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.</p>
