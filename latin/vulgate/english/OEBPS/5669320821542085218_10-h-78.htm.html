<p>28:5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</p>
<p>28:6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</p>
<p>28:7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</p>
<p>28:8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</p>
<p>28:9 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</p>
<p>28:10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</p>
<p>28:11 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</p>
<p>28:12 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 28:13 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</p>
<p>28:14 And if this come to the governorâ€™s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</p>
<p>28:15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</p>
<p>28:16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</p>
<p>28:17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</p>
<p>28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</p>
<p>28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 28:20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</p>
