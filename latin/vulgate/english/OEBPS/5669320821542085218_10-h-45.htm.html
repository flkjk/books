<p>139:7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</p>
<p>139:8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.</p>
<p>139:9 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</p>
<p>139:10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</p>
<p>139:11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.</p>
<p>139:12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.</p>
<p>139:13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb.</p>
<p>139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.</p>
<p>139:15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</p>
<p>139:16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.</p>
<p>139:17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!</p>
<p>139:18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.</p>
<p>139:19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.</p>
<p>139:20 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.</p>
<p>139:21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</p>
<p>139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</p>
<p>139:23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:</p>
<p>139:24 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</p>
<p>140:1 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;</p>
<p>140:2 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.</p>
<p>140:3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders’ poison is under their lips. Selah.</p>
<p>140:4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.</p>
<p>140:5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.</p>
<p>140:6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.</p>
<p>140:7 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.</p>
<p>140:8 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.</p>
<p>140:9 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.</p>
<p>140:10 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.</p>
<p>140:11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.</p>
<p>140:12 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.</p>
<p>140:13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.</p>
<p>141:1 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.</p>
<p>141:2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.</p>
<p>141:3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.</p>
<p>141:4 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.</p>
<p>141:5 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.</p>
<p>141:6 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.</p>
<p>141:7 Our bones are scattered at the grave’s mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.</p>
<p>141:8 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.</p>
<p>141:9 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p>141:10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.</p>
<p>142:1 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.</p>
<p>142:2 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.</p>
<p>142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path.</p>
<p>In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.</p>
<p>142:4 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.</p>
<p>142:5 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.</p>
<p>142:6 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.</p>
<p>142:7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.</p>
<p>143:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.</p>
<p>143:2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.</p>
<p>143:3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.</p>
<p>143:4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.</p>
<p>143:5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.</p>
<p>143:6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.</p>
<p>143:7 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.</p>
<p>143:8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.</p>
<p>143:9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.</p>
<p>143:10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.</p>
<p>143:11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name’s sake: for thy righteousness’ sake bring my soul out of trouble.</p>
<p>143:12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.</p>
<p>144:1 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:</p>
<p>144:2 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.</p>
<p>144:3 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!</p>
<p>144:4 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.</p>
<p>144:5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</p>
<p>144:6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.</p>
<p>144:7 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;</p>
<p>144:8 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</p>
<p>144:9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.</p>
<p>144:10 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.</p>
<p>144:11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:</p>
<p>144:12 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:</p>
<p>144:13 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:</p>
<p>144:14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.</p>
<p>144:15 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.</p>
<p>145:1 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.</p>
<p>145:2 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.</p>
<p>145:3 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.</p>
<p>145:4 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.</p>
<p>145:5 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.</p>
<p>145:6 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.</p>
<p>145:7 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.</p>
<p>145:8 The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.</p>
<p>145:9 The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.</p>
<p>145:10 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.</p>
<p>145:11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;</p>
<p>145:12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.</p>
<p>145:13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.</p>
<p>145:14 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.</p>
<p>145:15 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.</p>
<p>145:16 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.</p>
<p>145:17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</p>
<p>145:18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.</p>
<p>145:19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.</p>
<p>145:20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.</p>
<p>145:21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.</p>
<p>146:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.</p>
<p>146:2 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.</p>
<p>146:3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.</p>
<p>146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.</p>
<p>146:5 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:</p>
<p>146:6 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:</p>
<p>146:7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:</p>
<p>146:8 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:</p>
<p>146:9 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.</p>
<p>146:10 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>147:1 Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.</p>
<p>147:2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.</p>
<p>147:3 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.</p>
<p>147:4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.</p>
<p>147:5 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.</p>
<p>147:6 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.</p>
<p>147:7 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:</p>
<p>147:8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.</p>
<p>147:9 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.</p>
<p>147:10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.</p>
<p>147:11 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.</p>
<p>147:12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.</p>
<p>147:13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.</p>
<p>147:14 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.</p>
<p>147:15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.</p>
<p>147:16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.</p>
<p>147:17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?</p>
<p>147:18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.</p>
<p>147:19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.</p>
<p>147:20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>148:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.</p>
<p>148:2 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.</p>
<p>148:3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.</p>
<p>148:4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens.</p>
<p>148:5 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.</p>
<p>148:6 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.</p>
<p>148:7 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:</p>
<p>148:8 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word:</p>
<p>148:9 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:</p>
<p>148:10 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:</p>
<p>148:11 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:</p>
<p>148:12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:</p>
<p>148:13 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.</p>
<p>148:14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>149:1 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.</p>
<p>149:2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.</p>
<p>149:3 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.</p>
<p>149:4 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.</p>
<p>149:5 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.</p>
<p>149:6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand;</p>
<p>149:7 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people;</p>
<p>149:8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;</p>
<p>149:9 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>150:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.</p>
<p>150:2 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.</p>
<p>150:3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp.</p>
<p>150:4 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.</p>
<p>150:5 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.</p>
<p>150:6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
