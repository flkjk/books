<p>16:20 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people; 16:21 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, 16:22 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>
<p>16:23 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.</p>
<p>16:24 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.</p>
<p>16:25 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.</p>
<p>16:26 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.</p>
<p>16:27 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.</p>
<p>16:28 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.</p>
<p>16:29 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.</p>
<p>16:30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.</p>
<p>16:31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.</p>
<p>16:32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.</p>
<p>16:33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.</p>
<p>16:34 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>16:35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.</p>
<p>16:36 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.</p>
<p>16:37 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required: 16:38 And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters: 16:39 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon, 16:40 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel; 16:41 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever; 16:42 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.</p>
<p>16:43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.</p>
<p>17:1 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains.</p>
<p>17:2 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.</p>
<p>17:3 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 17:4 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in: 17:5 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.</p>
<p>17:6 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars? 17:7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: 17:8 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.</p>
<p>17:9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning, 17:10 And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.</p>
<p>17:11 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
<p>17:12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</p>
<p>17:13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee: 17:14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</p>
<p>17:15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>
<p>17:16 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 17:17 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</p>
<p>17:18 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</p>
<p>17:19 O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.</p>
<p>17:20 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</p>
<p>17:21 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? 17:22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</p>
<p>17:23 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>
<p>17:24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.</p>
<p>17:25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.</p>
<p>17:26 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 17:27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.</p>
<p>18:1 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>
<p>18:2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants, and brought gifts.</p>
<p>18:3 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</p>
<p>18:4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.</p>
<p>18:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</p>
<p>18:6 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David’s servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>
<p>18:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>18:8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</p>
<p>18:9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; 18:10 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.</p>
<p>18:11 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</p>
<p>18:12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.</p>
<p>18:13 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David’s servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>
<p>18:14 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.</p>
<p>18:15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.</p>
<p>18:16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; 18:17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.</p>
<p>19:1 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>19:2 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</p>
<p>19:3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? 19:4 Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</p>
<p>19:5 Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</p>
<p>19:6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.</p>
<p>19:7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</p>
<p>19:8 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</p>
<p>19:9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.</p>
<p>19:10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.</p>
<p>19:11 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.</p>
<p>19:12 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</p>
<p>19:13 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.</p>
<p>19:14 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.</p>
<p>19:15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>19:16 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.</p>
<p>19:17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</p>
<p>19:18 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</p>
<p>19:19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.</p>
<p>20:1 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.</p>
<p>20:2 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David’s head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.</p>
<p>20:3 And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>20:4 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.</p>
<p>20:5 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver’s beam.</p>
<p>20:6 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant.</p>
<p>20:7 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him.</p>
<p>20:8 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p>
<p>21:1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.</p>
<p>21:2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.</p>
<p>21:3 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel? 21:4 Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>21:5 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</p>
<p>21:6 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.</p>
<p>21:7 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</p>
<p>21:8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p>
<p>21:9 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying, 21:10 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</p>
<p>21:11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee 21:12 Either three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</p>
<p>21:13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</p>
<p>21:14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</p>
<p>21:15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<p>21:16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</p>
<p>21:17 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father’s house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</p>
<p>21:18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<p>21:19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>21:20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</p>
<p>21:21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</p>
<p>21:22 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</p>
<p>21:23 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</p>
<p>21:24 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</p>
<p>21:25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</p>
<p>21:26 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<p>21:27 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</p>
<p>21:28 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</p>
<p>21:29 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</p>
<p>21:30 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</p>
<p>22:1 Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.</p>
<p>22:2 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.</p>
<p>22:3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; 22:4 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.</p>
<p>22:5 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.</p>
<p>22:6 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p>22:7 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God: 22:8 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.</p>
<p>22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.</p>
<p>22:10 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.</p>
<p>22:11 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.</p>
<p>22:12 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.</p>
<p>22:13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</p>
<p>22:14 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.</p>
<p>22:15 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.</p>
<p>22:16 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.</p>
<p>22:17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, 22:18 Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.</p>
<p>22:19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>23:1 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.</p>
<p>23:2 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</p>
<p>23:3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.</p>
<p>23:4 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges: 23:5 Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.</p>
<p>23:6 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>
<p>23:7 Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.</p>
<p>23:8 The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.</p>
<p>23:9 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.</p>
<p>23:10 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah.</p>
<p>These four were the sons of Shimei.</p>
<p>23:11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father’s house.</p>
<p>23:12 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</p>
<p>23:13 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.</p>
<p>23:14 Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.</p>
<p>23:15 The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.</p>
<p>23:16 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.</p>
<p>23:17 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.</p>
<p>23:18 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.</p>
<p>23:19 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.</p>
<p>23:20 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.</p>
<p>23:21 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.</p>
<p>23:22 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.</p>
<p>23:23 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.</p>
<p>23:24 These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.</p>
<p>23:25 For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever: 23:26 And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.</p>
<p>23:27 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above: 23:28 Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; 23:29 Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; 23:30 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even: 23:31 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD: 23:32 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>24:1 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>
<p>24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office.</p>
<p>24:3 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.</p>
<p>24:4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.</p>
<p>24:5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.</p>
<p>24:6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.</p>
<p>24:7 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 24:8 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 24:9 The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 24:10 The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 24:11 The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah, 24:12 The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 24:13 The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, 24:14 The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, 24:15 The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses, 24:16 The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel, 24:17 The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul, 24:18 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.</p>
<p>24:19 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.</p>
<p>24:20 And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.</p>
<p>24:21 Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.</p>
<p>24:22 Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.</p>
<p>24:23 And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.</p>
<p>24:24 Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.</p>
<p>24:25 The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah.</p>
<p>24:26 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.</p>
<p>24:27 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.</p>
<p>24:28 Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.</p>
<p>24:29 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.</p>
<p>24:30 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.</p>
<p>24:31 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.</p>
<p>25:1 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was: 25:2 Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of the king.</p>
<p>25:3 Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD.</p>
<p>25:4 Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth: 25:5 All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.</p>
<p>25:6 All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king’s order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.</p>
<p>25:7 So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.</p>
<p>25:8 And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.</p>
<p>25:9 Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve: 25:10 The third to Zaccur, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:11 The fourth to Izri, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:12 The fifth to Nethaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:13 The sixth to Bukkiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:14 The seventh to Jesharelah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:15 The eighth to Jeshaiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:16 The ninth to Mattaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:17 The tenth to Shimei, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:18 The eleventh to Azareel, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:19 The twelfth to Hashabiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:20 The thirteenth to Shubael, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:21 The fourteenth to Mattithiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:22 The fifteenth to Jeremoth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:23 The sixteenth to Hananiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:24 The seventeenth to Joshbekashah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:25 The eighteenth to Hanani, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:26 The nineteenth to Mallothi, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:27 The twentieth to Eliathah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:28 The one and twentieth to Hothir, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:29 The two and twentieth to Giddalti, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:30 The three and twentieth to Mahazioth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 25:31 The four and twentieth to Romamtiezer, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve.</p>
<p>26:1 Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.</p>
<p>26:2 And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth, 26:3 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.</p>
<p>26:4 Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth.</p>
<p>26:5 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth: for God blessed him.</p>
<p>26:6 Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men of valour.</p>
<p>26:7 The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.</p>
<p>26:8 All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were threescore and two of Obededom.</p>
<p>26:9 And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.</p>
<p>26:10 Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;) 26:11 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.</p>
<p>26:12 Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>26:13 And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.</p>
<p>26:14 And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.</p>
<p>26:15 To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.</p>
<p>26:16 To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.</p>
<p>26:17 Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and toward Asuppim two and two.</p>
<p>26:18 At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.</p>
<p>26:19 These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore, and among the sons of Merari.</p>
<p>26:20 And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.</p>
<p>26:21 As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite, were Jehieli.</p>
<p>26:22 The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were over the treasures of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>26:23 Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites: 26:24 And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the treasures.</p>
<p>26:25 And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.</p>
<p>26:26 Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated.</p>
<p>26:27 Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>26:28 And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren.</p>
<p>26:29 Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.</p>
<p>26:30 And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valour, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in the service of the king.</p>
<p>26:31 Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead.</p>
<p>26:32 And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.</p>
<p>27:1 Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:2 Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:3 Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month.</p>
<p>27:4 And over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite, and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:5 The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:6 This is that Benaiah, who was mighty among the thirty, and above the thirty: and in his course was Ammizabad his son.</p>
<p>27:7 The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:8 The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:9 The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:10 The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:11 The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:12 The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anetothite, of the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:13 The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:14 The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:15 The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p>27:16 Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maachah: 27:17 Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the Aaronites, Zadok: 27:18 Of Judah, Elihu, one of the brethren of David: of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael: 27:19 Of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jerimoth the son of Azriel: 27:20 Of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of the half tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah: 27:21 Of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner: 27:22 Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>27:23 But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens.</p>
<p>27:24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.</p>
<p>27:25 And over the king’s treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah: 27:26 And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub: 27:27 And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite: 27:28 And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash: 27:29 And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai: 27:30 Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: 27:31 And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David’s.</p>
<p>27:32 Also Jonathan David’s uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king’s sons: 27:33 And Ahithophel was the king’s counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was the king’s companion: 27:34 And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the king’s army was Joab.</p>
<p>28:1 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.</p>
<p>28:2 Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building: 28:3 But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.</p>
<p>28:4 Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel: 28:5 And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.</p>
<p>28:6 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.</p>
<p>28:7 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.</p>
<p>28:8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.</p>
<p>28:9 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</p>
<p>28:10 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.</p>
<p>28:11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat, 28:12 And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things: 28:13 Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>28:14 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service: 28:15 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.</p>
<p>28:16 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver: 28:17 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver: 28:18 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</p>
<p>28:19 All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.</p>
<p>28:20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>28:21 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.</p>
<p>29:1 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.</p>
<p>29:2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</p>
<p>29:3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.</p>
<p>29:4 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal: 29:5 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD? 29:6 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king’s work, offered willingly, 29:7 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</p>
<p>29:8 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</p>
<p>29:9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</p>
<p>29:10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.</p>
<p>29:11 Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.</p>
<p>29:12 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.</p>
<p>29:13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</p>
<p>29:14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</p>
<p>29:15 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.</p>
<p>29:16 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.</p>
<p>29:17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.</p>
<p>29:18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee: 29:19 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.</p>
<p>29:20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God.</p>
<p>And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.</p>
<p>29:21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: 29:22 And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.</p>
<p>29:23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</p>
<p>29:24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</p>
<p>29:25 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</p>
<p>29:26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</p>
<p>29:27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>29:28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>29:29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, 29:30 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</p>
