<p>74:2 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.</p>
<p>74:3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>74:4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.</p>
<p>74:5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.</p>
<p>74:6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.</p>
<p>74:7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.</p>
<p>74:8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</p>
<p>74:9 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.</p>
<p>74:10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</p>
<p>74:11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.</p>
<p>74:12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</p>
<p>74:13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.</p>
<p>74:14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</p>
<p>74:15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.</p>
<p>74:16 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.</p>
<p>74:17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.</p>
<p>74:18 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.</p>
<p>74:19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.</p>
<p>74:20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</p>
<p>74:21 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.</p>
<p>74:22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.</p>
<p>74:23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.</p>
<p>75:1 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.</p>
<p>75:2 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.</p>
<p>75:3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.</p>
<p>75:4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:</p>
<p>75:5 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.</p>
<p>75:6 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.</p>
<p>75:7 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</p>
<p>75:8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.</p>
<p>75:9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</p>
<p>75:10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.</p>
<p>76:1 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.</p>
<p>76:2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.</p>
<p>76:3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.</p>
<p>76:4 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.</p>
<p>76:5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.</p>
<p>76:6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.</p>
<p>76:7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</p>
<p>76:8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,</p>
<p>76:9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.</p>
<p>76:10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</p>
<p>76:11 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.</p>
<p>76:12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.</p>
<p>77:1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.</p>
<p>77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.</p>
<p>77:3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.</p>
<p>77:4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</p>
<p>77:5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</p>
<p>77:6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.</p>
<p>77:7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</p>
<p>77:8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?</p>
<p>77:9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.</p>
<p>77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.</p>
<p>77:11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.</p>
<p>77:12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.</p>
<p>77:13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?</p>
<p>77:14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.</p>
<p>77:15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.</p>
<p>77:16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.</p>
<p>77:17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.</p>
<p>77:18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.</p>
<p>77:19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.</p>
<p>77:20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>
<p>78:1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p>78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</p>
<p>78:3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>
<p>78:4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</p>
<p>78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p>
<p>78:6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</p>
<p>78:7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</p>
<p>78:8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</p>
<p>78:9 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p>
<p>78:10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</p>
<p>78:11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p>
<p>78:12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p>
<p>78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>
<p>78:14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</p>
<p>78:15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</p>
<p>78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>
<p>78:17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>
<p>78:18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</p>
<p>78:19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>
<p>78:20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</p>
<p>78:21 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>
<p>78:22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p>
<p>78:23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p>
<p>78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p>
<p>78:25 Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
<p>78:26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>
<p>78:27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p>
<p>78:28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</p>
<p>78:29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>
<p>78:30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</p>
<p>78:31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p>
<p>78:32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p>
<p>78:33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>
<p>78:34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</p>
<p>78:35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</p>
<p>78:36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</p>
<p>78:37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>
<p>78:38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>
<p>78:39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p>
<p>78:40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</p>
<p>78:41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>78:42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</p>
<p>78:43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.</p>
<p>78:44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>
<p>78:45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p>78:46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p>
<p>78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p>
<p>78:48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>
<p>78:49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</p>
<p>78:50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>
<p>78:51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
<p>78:52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
<p>78:53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p>78:54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p>
<p>78:55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
<p>78:56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>
<p>78:57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p>78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
<p>78:59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>
<p>78:60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</p>
<p>78:61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.</p>
<p>78:62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>
<p>78:63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p>
<p>78:64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>
<p>78:65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p>
<p>78:66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
<p>78:67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>
<p>78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>
<p>78:69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</p>
<p>78:70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>
<p>78:71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>
<p>78:72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>
<p>79:1 O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.</p>
<p>79:2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p>79:3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.</p>
<p>79:4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.</p>
<p>79:5 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</p>
<p>79:6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.</p>
<p>79:7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.</p>
<p>79:8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.</p>
<p>79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.</p>
<p>79:10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.</p>
<p>79:11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;</p>
<p>79:12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</p>
<p>79:13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.</p>
<p>80:1 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.</p>
<p>80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.</p>
<p>80:3 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
<p>80:4 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?</p>
<p>80:5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.</p>
<p>80:6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.</p>
<p>80:7 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
<p>80:8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.</p>
<p>80:9 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.</p>
<p>80:10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.</p>
<p>80:11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.</p>
<p>80:12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?</p>
<p>80:13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.</p>
<p>80:14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;</p>
<p>80:15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.</p>
<p>80:16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.</p>
<p>80:17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.</p>
<p>80:18 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.</p>
<p>80:19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
<p>81:1 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.</p>
<p>81:2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.</p>
<p>81:3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.</p>
<p>81:4 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.</p>
<p>81:5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.</p>
<p>81:6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.</p>
<p>81:7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah.</p>
<p>Selah.</p>
<p>81:8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;</p>
<p>81:9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.</p>
<p>81:10 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</p>
<p>81:11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</p>
<p>81:12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: and they walked in their own counsels.</p>
<p>81:13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!</p>
<p>81:14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.</p>
<p>81:15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.</p>
<p>81:16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.</p>
<p>82:1 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.</p>
<p>82:2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.</p>
<p>82:3 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.</p>
<p>82:4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.</p>
<p>82:5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.</p>
<p>82:6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.</p>
<p>82:7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</p>
<p>82:8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.</p>
<p>83:1 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.</p>
<p>83:2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</p>
<p>83:3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</p>
<p>83:4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</p>
<p>83:5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:</p>
<p>83:6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;</p>
<p>83:7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;</p>
<p>83:8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot.</p>
<p>Selah.</p>
<p>83:9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:</p>
<p>83:10 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.</p>
<p>83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:</p>
<p>83:12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.</p>
<p>83:13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.</p>
<p>83:14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;</p>
<p>83:15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.</p>
<p>83:16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.</p>
<p>83:17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</p>
<p>83:18 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.</p>
<p>84:1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!</p>
<p>84:2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.</p>
<p>84:3 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.</p>
<p>84:4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.</p>
<p>84:5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.</p>
<p>84:6 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.</p>
<p>84:7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.</p>
<p>84:8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.</p>
<p>84:9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.</p>
<p>84:10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.</p>
<p>84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</p>
<p>84:12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.</p>
<p>85:1 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.</p>
<p>85:2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.</p>
<p>85:3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.</p>
<p>85:4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.</p>
<p>85:5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?</p>
<p>85:6 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?</p>
<p>85:7 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.</p>
<p>85:8 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.</p>
<p>85:9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.</p>
<p>85:10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</p>
<p>85:11 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.</p>
<p>85:12 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.</p>
<p>85:13 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.</p>
<p>86:1 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.</p>
<p>86:2 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.</p>
<p>86:3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.</p>
<p>86:4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.</p>
<p>86:5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.</p>
<p>86:6 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.</p>
<p>86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.</p>
<p>86:8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.</p>
<p>86:9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.</p>
<p>86:10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.</p>
<p>86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.</p>
<p>86:12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.</p>
<p>86:13 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.</p>
<p>86:14 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.</p>
<p>86:15 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.</p>
<p>86:16 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.</p>
<p>86:17 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.</p>
<p>87:1 His foundation is in the holy mountains.</p>
<p>87:2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</p>
<p>87:3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.</p>
<p>87:4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.</p>
<p>87:5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.</p>
<p>87:6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah.</p>
<p>87:7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.</p>
<p>88:1 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:</p>
<p>88:2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;</p>
<p>88:3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.</p>
<p>88:4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:</p>
<p>88:5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.</p>
<p>88:6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.</p>
<p>88:7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.</p>
<p>88:8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.</p>
<p>88:9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.</p>
<p>88:10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.</p>
<p>88:11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?</p>
<p>88:12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</p>
<p>88:13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.</p>
<p>88:14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?</p>
<p>88:15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.</p>
<p>88:16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.</p>
<p>88:17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.</p>
<p>88:18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.</p>
<p>89:1 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.</p>
<p>89:2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.</p>
<p>89:3 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,</p>
<p>89:4 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.</p>
<p>89:5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.</p>
<p>89:6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?</p>
<p>89:7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.</p>
<p>89:8 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?</p>
<p>89:9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.</p>
<p>89:10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.</p>
<p>89:11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.</p>
<p>89:12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.</p>
<p>89:13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.</p>
<p>89:14 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.</p>
<p>89:15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.</p>
<p>89:16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.</p>
<p>89:17 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.</p>
<p>89:18 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.</p>
<p>89:19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.</p>
<p>89:20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:</p>
<p>89:21 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.</p>
<p>89:22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</p>
<p>89:23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.</p>
<p>89:24 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</p>
<p>89:25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.</p>
<p>89:26 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.</p>
<p>89:27 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.</p>
<p>89:28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.</p>
<p>89:29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.</p>
<p>89:30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;</p>
<p>89:31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;</p>
<p>89:32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</p>
<p>89:33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</p>
<p>89:34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</p>
<p>89:35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.</p>
<p>89:36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.</p>
<p>89:37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.</p>
<p>89:38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.</p>
<p>89:39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.</p>
<p>89:40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.</p>
<p>89:41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.</p>
<p>89:42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</p>
<p>89:43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.</p>
<p>89:44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.</p>
<p>89:45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.</p>
<p>89:46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?</p>
<p>89:47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</p>
<p>89:48 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.</p>
<p>89:49 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?</p>
<p>89:50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;</p>
<p>89:51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.</p>
<p>89:52 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.</p>
<p>90:1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</p>
<p>90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.</p>
<p>90:3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.</p>
<p>90:4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.</p>
<p>90:5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.</p>
<p>90:6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</p>
<p>90:7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.</p>
<p>90:8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.</p>
<p>90:9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.</p>
<p>90:10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p>
<p>90:11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.</p>
<p>90:12 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</p>
<p>90:13 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</p>
<p>90:14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</p>
<p>90:15 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.</p>
<p>90:16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.</p>
<p>90:17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</p>
<p>91:1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</p>
<p>91:2 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.</p>
<p>91:3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.</p>
<p>91:4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.</p>
<p>91:5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;</p>
<p>91:6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.</p>
<p>91:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.</p>
<p>91:8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.</p>
<p>91:9 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;</p>
<p>91:10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</p>
<p>91:11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.</p>
<p>91:12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
<p>91:13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.</p>
<p>91:14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.</p>
<p>91:15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.</p>
<p>91:16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.</p>
<p>92:1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:</p>
<p>92:2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,</p>
<p>92:3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.</p>
<p>92:4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.</p>
<p>92:5 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.</p>
<p>92:6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.</p>
<p>92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:</p>
<p>92:8 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.</p>
<p>92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</p>
<p>92:10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.</p>
<p>92:11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.</p>
<p>92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</p>
<p>92:13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.</p>
<p>92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;</p>
<p>92:15 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</p>
<p>93:1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.</p>
<p>93:2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.</p>
<p>93:3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.</p>
<p>93:4 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.</p>
<p>93:5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.</p>
<p>94:1 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.</p>
<p>94:2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.</p>
<p>94:3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?</p>
<p>94:4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?</p>
<p>94:5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.</p>
<p>94:6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.</p>
<p>94:7 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.</p>
<p>94:8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?</p>
<p>94:9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?</p>
<p>94:10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?</p>
<p>94:11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.</p>
<p>94:12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;</p>
<p>94:13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.</p>
<p>94:14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.</p>
<p>94:15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.</p>
<p>94:16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p>94:17 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.</p>
<p>94:18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.</p>
<p>94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.</p>
<p>94:20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?</p>
<p>94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.</p>
<p>94:22 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.</p>
<p>94:23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.</p>
<p>95:1 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.</p>
<p>95:2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.</p>
<p>95:3 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.</p>
<p>95:4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.</p>
<p>95:5 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.</p>
<p>95:6 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.</p>
<p>95:7 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,</p>
<p>95:8 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</p>
<p>95:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.</p>
<p>95:10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:</p>
<p>95:11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.</p>
<p>96:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.</p>
<p>96:2 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.</p>
<p>96:3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.</p>
<p>96:4 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.</p>
<p>96:5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.</p>
<p>96:6 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.</p>
<p>96:7 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.</p>
<p>96:8 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.</p>
<p>96:9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.</p>
<p>96:10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.</p>
<p>96:11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.</p>
<p>96:12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice</p>
<p>96:13 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.</p>
<p>97:1 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.</p>
<p>97:2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</p>
<p>97:3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.</p>
<p>97:4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.</p>
<p>97:5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.</p>
<p>97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.</p>
<p>97:7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.</p>
<p>97:8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.</p>
<p>97:9 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.</p>
<p>97:10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.</p>
<p>97:11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.</p>
<p>97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</p>
<p>98:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.</p>
<p>98:2 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.</p>
<p>98:3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>
<p>98:4 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.</p>
<p>98:5 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.</p>
<p>98:6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.</p>
<p>98:7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</p>
<p>98:8 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together</p>
<p>98:9 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.</p>
<p>99:1 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.</p>
<p>99:2 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.</p>
<p>99:3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.</p>
<p>99:4 The king’s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.</p>
<p>99:5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.</p>
<p>99:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.</p>
<p>99:7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.</p>
<p>99:8 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.</p>
<p>99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.</p>
<p>100:1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.</p>
<p>100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.</p>
<p>100:3 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.</p>
<p>100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.</p>
<p>100:5 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.</p>
<p>101:1 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.</p>
<p>101:2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</p>
<p>101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.</p>
<p>101:4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.</p>
<p>101:5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.</p>
<p>101:6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.</p>
<p>101:7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.</p>
<p>101:8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.</p>
<p>102:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.</p>
<p>102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.</p>
<p>102:3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.</p>
<p>102:4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.</p>
<p>102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.</p>
<p>102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.</p>
<p>102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</p>
<p>102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.</p>
<p>102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.</p>
<p>102:10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</p>
<p>102:11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.</p>
<p>102:12 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.</p>
<p>102:13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.</p>
<p>102:14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.</p>
<p>102:15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</p>
<p>102:16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.</p>
<p>102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</p>
<p>102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</p>
<p>102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;</p>
<p>102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;</p>
<p>102:21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;</p>
<p>102:22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</p>
<p>102:23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.</p>
<p>102:24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.</p>
<p>102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</p>
<p>102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:</p>
<p>102:27 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.</p>
<p>102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</p>
<p>103:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.</p>
<p>103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</p>
<p>103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</p>
<p>103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</p>
<p>103:5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.</p>
<p>103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</p>
<p>103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p>103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</p>
<p>103:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.</p>
<p>103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</p>
<p>103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</p>
<p>103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</p>
<p>103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.</p>
<p>103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.</p>
<p>103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</p>
<p>103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.</p>
<p>103:17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children;</p>
<p>103:18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</p>
<p>103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</p>
<p>103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.</p>
<p>103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.</p>
<p>103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.</p>
<p>104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</p>
<p>104:2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:</p>
<p>104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</p>
<p>104:4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</p>
<p>104:5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.</p>
<p>104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.</p>
<p>104:7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</p>
<p>104:8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</p>
<p>104:9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</p>
<p>104:10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.</p>
<p>104:11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.</p>
<p>104:12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.</p>
<p>104:13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</p>
<p>104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;</p>
<p>104:15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man’s heart.</p>
<p>104:16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</p>
<p>104:17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.</p>
<p>104:18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.</p>
<p>104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</p>
<p>104:20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.</p>
<p>104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.</p>
<p>104:22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.</p>
<p>104:23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</p>
<p>104:24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</p>
<p>104:25 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.</p>
<p>104:26 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.</p>
<p>104:27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.</p>
<p>104:28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.</p>
<p>104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</p>
<p>104:30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</p>
<p>104:31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.</p>
<p>104:32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</p>
<p>104:33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>
<p>104:34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.</p>
<p>104:35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>105:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</p>
<p>105:2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>
<p>105:3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</p>
<p>105:4 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</p>
<p>105:5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>
<p>105:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</p>
<p>105:7 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</p>
<p>105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.</p>
<p>105:9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</p>
<p>105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</p>
<p>105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</p>
<p>105:12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</p>
<p>105:13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;</p>
<p>105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</p>
<p>105:15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>
<p>105:16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</p>
<p>105:17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:</p>
<p>105:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</p>
<p>105:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</p>
<p>105:20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</p>
<p>105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</p>
<p>105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</p>
<p>105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p>
