And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: 22:68 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</p>
<p>22:69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</p>
<p>22:70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</p>
<p>22:71 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</p>
<p>23:1 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</p>
<p>23:2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</p>
<p>23:3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</p>
<p>23:4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</p>
<p>23:5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p>
<p>23:6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</p>
<p>23:7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herodâ€™s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p>
<p>23:8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p>
<p>23:9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</p>
<p>23:10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</p>
<p>23:11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</p>
<p>23:12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>
<p>23:13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 23:14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: 23:15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</p>
<p>23:16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p>
<p>23:17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) 23:18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: 23:19 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) 23:20 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</p>
<p>23:21 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</p>
<p>23:22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</p>
<p>23:23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</p>
<p>23:24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p>
<p>23:25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</p>
<p>23:26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</p>
<p>23:27 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</p>
<p>23:28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>
<p>23:29 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</p>
<p>23:30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</p>
<p>23:31 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? 23:32 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</p>
<p>23:33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</p>
<p>23:34 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>
<p>23:35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</p>
<p>23:36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, 23:37 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>
<p>23:38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p>23:39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p>
<p>23:40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 23:41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>
<p>23:42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</p>
<p>23:43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</p>
<p>23:44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</p>
<p>23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</p>
<p>23:46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>23:47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</p>
<p>23:48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</p>
<p>23:49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p>
<p>23:50 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just: 23:51 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>23:52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>
<p>23:53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</p>
<p>23:54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p>
<p>23:55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</p>
<p>23:56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</p>
<p>24:1 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</p>
<p>24:2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p>
<p>24:3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>24:4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: 24:5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 24:6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, 24:7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</p>
<p>24:8 And they remembered his words, 24:9 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>
<p>24:10 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</p>
<p>24:11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</p>
<p>24:12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</p>
<p>24:13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</p>
<p>24:14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</p>
<p>24:15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</p>
<p>24:16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p>
<p>24:17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? 24:18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? 24:19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: 24:20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</p>
<p>24:21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</p>
<p>24:22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; 24:23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</p>
<p>24:24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</p>
<p>24:25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: 24:26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? 24:27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
<p>24:28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</p>
<p>24:29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</p>
<p>24:30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</p>
<p>24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</p>
<p>24:32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? 24:33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 24:34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p>
<p>24:35 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</p>
<p>24:36 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p>
<p>24:37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</p>
<p>24:38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? 24:39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</p>
<p>24:40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</p>
<p>24:41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? 24:42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</p>
<p>24:43 And he took it, and did eat before them.</p>
<p>24:44 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</p>
<p>24:45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, 24:46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: 24:47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>24:48 And ye are witnesses of these things.</p>
<p>24:49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</p>
<p>24:50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</p>
<p>24:51 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</p>
<p>24:52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: 24:53 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>
