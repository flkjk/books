<p>38:6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</p>
<p>38:7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.</p>
<p>38:8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</p>
<p>38:9 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</p>
<p>38:10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</p>
<p>38:11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</p>
<p>38:12 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</p>
<p>38:13 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.</p>
<p>38:14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.</p>
<p>38:15 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</p>
<p>38:16 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.</p>
<p>38:17 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.</p>
<p>38:18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</p>
<p>38:19 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</p>
<p>38:20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.</p>
<p>38:21 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.</p>
<p>38:22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.</p>
<p>39:1 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.</p>
<p>39:2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.</p>
<p>39:3 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,</p>
<p>39:4 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.</p>
<p>39:5 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity.</p>
<p>Selah.</p>
<p>39:6 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.</p>
<p>39:7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.</p>
<p>39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.</p>
<p>39:9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.</p>
<p>39:10 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.</p>
<p>39:11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.</p>
<p>39:12 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.</p>
<p>39:13 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.</p>
<p>40:1 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.</p>
<p>40:2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.</p>
<p>40:3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.</p>
<p>40:4 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</p>
<p>40:5 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.</p>
<p>40:6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.</p>
<p>40:7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,</p>
<p>40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.</p>
<p>40:9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.</p>
<p>40:10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.</p>
<p>40:11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</p>
<p>40:12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.</p>
<p>40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.</p>
<p>40:14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.</p>
<p>40:15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.</p>
<p>40:16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.</p>
<p>40:17 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.</p>
<p>41:1 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.</p>
<p>41:2 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.</p>
<p>41:3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.</p>
<p>41:4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.</p>
<p>41:5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?</p>
<p>41:6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.</p>
<p>41:7 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.</p>
<p>41:8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.</p>
<p>41:9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.</p>
<p>41:10 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.</p>
<p>41:11 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.</p>
<p>41:12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.</p>
<p>41:13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.</p>
<p>42:1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.</p>
<p>42:2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?</p>
<p>42:3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?</p>
<p>42:4 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.</p>
<p>42:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.</p>
<p>42:6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.</p>
<p>42:7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.</p>
<p>42:8 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.</p>
<p>42:9 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</p>
<p>42:10 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?</p>
<p>42:11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</p>
<p>43:1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.</p>
<p>43:2 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</p>
<p>43:3 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.</p>
<p>43:4 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.</p>
<p>43:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</p>
<p>44:1 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.</p>
<p>44:2 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.</p>
<p>44:3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.</p>
<p>44:4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.</p>
<p>44:5 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.</p>
<p>44:6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.</p>
<p>44:7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.</p>
<p>44:8 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.</p>
<p>Selah.</p>
<p>44:9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.</p>
<p>44:10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.</p>
<p>44:11 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.</p>
<p>44:12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.</p>
<p>44:13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.</p>
<p>44:14 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.</p>
<p>44:15 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,</p>
<p>44:16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.</p>
<p>44:17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.</p>
<p>44:18 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;</p>
<p>44:19 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.</p>
<p>44:20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;</p>
<p>44:21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.</p>
<p>44:22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>
<p>44:23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.</p>
<p>44:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?</p>
<p>44:25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.</p>
<p>44:26 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies’ sake.</p>
<p>45:1 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</p>
<p>45:2 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.</p>
<p>45:3 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.</p>
<p>45:4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.</p>
<p>45:5 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.</p>
<p>45:6 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.</p>
<p>45:7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</p>
<p>45:8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.</p>
<p>45:9 Kings’ daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.</p>
<p>45:10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house;</p>
<p>45:11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.</p>
<p>45:12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.</p>
<p>45:13 The king’s daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.</p>
<p>45:14 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.</p>
<p>45:15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king’s palace.</p>
<p>45:16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.</p>
<p>45:17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.</p>
<p>46:1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.</p>
<p>46:2 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;</p>
<p>46:3 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.</p>
<p>46:4 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.</p>
<p>46:5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.</p>
<p>46:6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.</p>
<p>46:7 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.</p>
<p>46:8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.</p>
<p>46:9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.</p>
<p>46:10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.</p>
<p>46:11 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.</p>
<p>47:1 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.</p>
<p>47:2 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.</p>
<p>47:3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.</p>
<p>47:4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.</p>
<p>47:5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.</p>
<p>47:6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.</p>
<p>47:7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.</p>
<p>47:8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.</p>
<p>47:9 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.</p>
<p>48:1 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.</p>
<p>48:2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.</p>
<p>48:3 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.</p>
<p>48:4 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.</p>
<p>48:5 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.</p>
<p>48:6 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.</p>
<p>48:7 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.</p>
<p>48:8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.</p>
<p>48:9 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.</p>
<p>48:10 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.</p>
<p>48:11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.</p>
<p>48:12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.</p>
<p>48:13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.</p>
<p>48:14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.</p>
<p>49:1 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:</p>
<p>49:2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.</p>
<p>49:3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.</p>
<p>49:4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</p>
<p>49:5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?</p>
<p>49:6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</p>
<p>49:7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:</p>
<p>49:8 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)</p>
<p>49:9 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.</p>
<p>49:10 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.</p>
<p>49:11 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.</p>
<p>49:12 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.</p>
<p>49:13 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.</p>
<p>49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.</p>
<p>49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.</p>
<p>49:16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;</p>
<p>49:17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.</p>
<p>49:18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.</p>
<p>49:19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.</p>
<p>49:20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.</p>
<p>50:1 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.</p>
<p>50:2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.</p>
<p>50:3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.</p>
<p>50:4 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.</p>
<p>50:5 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</p>
<p>50:6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.</p>
<p>50:7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.</p>
<p>50:8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.</p>
<p>50:9 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.</p>
<p>50:10 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.</p>
<p>50:11 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.</p>
<p>50:12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.</p>
<p>50:13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</p>
<p>50:14 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:</p>
<p>50:15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</p>
<p>50:16 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?</p>
<p>50:17 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind thee.</p>
<p>50:18 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.</p>
<p>50:19 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.</p>
<p>50:20 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son.</p>
<p>50:21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.</p>
<p>50:22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</p>
<p>50:23 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.</p>
<p>51:1 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.</p>
<p>51:2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>
<p>51:3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.</p>
<p>51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.</p>
<p>51:5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.</p>
<p>51:6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.</p>
<p>51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
<p>51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.</p>
<p>51:9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.</p>
<p>51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.</p>
<p>51:11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.</p>
<p>51:12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.</p>
<p>51:13 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.</p>
<p>51:14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.</p>
<p>51:15 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.</p>
<p>51:16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.</p>
<p>51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</p>
<p>51:18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>51:19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.</p>
<p>52:1 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually.</p>
<p>52:2 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.</p>
<p>52:3 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.</p>
<p>52:4 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.</p>
<p>52:5 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.</p>
<p>52:6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:</p>
<p>52:7 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.</p>
<p>52:8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.</p>
<p>52:9 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.</p>
<p>53:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.</p>
<p>53:2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.</p>
<p>53:3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
<p>53:4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.</p>
<p>53:5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.</p>
<p>53:6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
<p>54:1 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.</p>
<p>54:2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p>54:3 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.</p>
<p>54:4 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.</p>
<p>54:5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.</p>
<p>54:6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.</p>
<p>54:7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.</p>
<p>55:1 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.</p>
<p>55:2 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</p>
<p>55:3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</p>
<p>55:4 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</p>
<p>55:5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</p>
<p>55:6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.</p>
<p>55:7 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.</p>
<p>55:8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.</p>
<p>55:9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p>
<p>55:10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.</p>
<p>55:11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</p>
<p>55:12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</p>
<p>55:13 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</p>
<p>55:14 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.</p>
<p>55:15 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.</p>
<p>55:16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.</p>
<p>55:17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</p>
<p>55:18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.</p>
<p>55:19 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.</p>
<p>Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</p>
<p>55:20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.</p>
<p>55:21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.</p>
<p>55:22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.</p>
<p>55:23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.</p>
<p>56:1 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.</p>
<p>56:2 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High.</p>
<p>56:3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.</p>
<p>56:4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.</p>
<p>56:5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.</p>
<p>56:6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.</p>
<p>56:7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God.</p>
<p>56:8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?</p>
<p>56:9 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.</p>
<p>56:10 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.</p>
<p>56:11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.</p>
<p>56:12 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.</p>
<p>56:13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?</p>
<p>57:1 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.</p>
<p>57:2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.</p>
<p>57:3 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.</p>
<p>57:4 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.</p>
<p>57:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.</p>
<p>57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.</p>
<p>57:7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.</p>
<p>57:8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.</p>
<p>57:9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.</p>
<p>57:10 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.</p>
<p>57:11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.</p>
<p>58:1 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?</p>
<p>58:2 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.</p>
<p>58:3 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.</p>
<p>58:4 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;</p>
<p>58:5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.</p>
<p>58:6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.</p>
<p>58:7 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.</p>
<p>58:8 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.</p>
<p>58:9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.</p>
<p>58:10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.</p>
<p>58:11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</p>
<p>59:1 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.</p>
<p>59:2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.</p>
<p>59:3 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.</p>
<p>59:4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.</p>
<p>59:5 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.</p>
<p>59:6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</p>
<p>59:7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?</p>
<p>59:8 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.</p>
<p>59:9 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.</p>
<p>59:10 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.</p>
<p>59:11 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.</p>
<p>59:12 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.</p>
<p>59:13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.</p>
<p>59:14 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</p>
<p>59:15 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.</p>
<p>59:16 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.</p>
<p>59:17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.</p>
<p>60:1 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.</p>
<p>60:2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.</p>
<p>60:3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.</p>
<p>60:4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.</p>
<p>60:5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.</p>
<p>60:6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</p>
<p>60:7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;</p>
<p>60:8 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.</p>
<p>60:9 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?</p>
<p>60:10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?</p>
<p>60:11 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.</p>
<p>60:12 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.</p>
<p>61:1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.</p>
<p>61:2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</p>
<p>61:3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.</p>
<p>61:4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.</p>
<p>61:5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.</p>
<p>61:6 Thou wilt prolong the king’s life: and his years as many generations.</p>
<p>61:7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.</p>
<p>61:8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.</p>
<p>62:1 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.</p>
<p>62:2 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.</p>
<p>62:3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.</p>
<p>62:4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.</p>
<p>62:5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.</p>
<p>62:6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.</p>
<p>62:7 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.</p>
<p>62:8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.</p>
<p>62:9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.</p>
<p>62:10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.</p>
<p>62:11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.</p>
<p>62:12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.</p>
<p>63:1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;</p>
<p>63:2 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>63:3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.</p>
<p>63:4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.</p>
<p>63:5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:</p>
<p>63:6 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</p>
<p>63:7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.</p>
<p>63:8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.</p>
<p>63:9 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.</p>
<p>63:10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.</p>
<p>63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.</p>
<p>64:1 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</p>
<p>64:2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:</p>
<p>64:3 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:</p>
<p>64:4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</p>
<p>64:5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?</p>
<p>64:6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.</p>
<p>64:7 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.</p>
<p>64:8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.</p>
<p>64:9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.</p>
<p>64:10 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.</p>
<p>65:1 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.</p>
<p>65:2 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.</p>
<p>65:3 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.</p>
<p>65:4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.</p>
<p>65:5 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:</p>
<p>65:6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power:</p>
<p>65:7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.</p>
<p>65:8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.</p>
<p>65:9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.</p>
<p>65:10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.</p>
<p>65:11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.</p>
<p>65:12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.</p>
<p>65:13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.</p>
<p>66:1 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:</p>
<p>66:2 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.</p>
<p>66:3 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.</p>
<p>66:4 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah.</p>
<p>66:5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.</p>
<p>66:6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.</p>
<p>66:7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.</p>
<p>66:8 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:</p>
<p>66:9 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.</p>
<p>66:10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.</p>
<p>66:11 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.</p>
<p>66:12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.</p>
<p>66:13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,</p>
<p>66:14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.</p>
<p>66:15 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.</p>
<p>66:16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.</p>
<p>66:17 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.</p>
<p>66:18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:</p>
<p>66:19 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.</p>
<p>66:20 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.</p>
<p>67:1 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah.</p>
<p>67:2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.</p>
<p>67:3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.</p>
<p>67:4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.</p>
<p>67:5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.</p>
<p>67:6 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.</p>
<p>67:7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.</p>
<p>68:1 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.</p>
<p>68:2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</p>
<p>68:3 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.</p>
<p>68:4 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.</p>
<p>68:5 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.</p>
<p>68:6 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.</p>
<p>68:7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:</p>
<p>68:8 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.</p>
<p>68:9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.</p>
<p>68:10 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.</p>
<p>68:11 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.</p>
<p>68:12 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.</p>
<p>68:13 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.</p>
<p>68:14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.</p>
<p>68:15 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.</p>
<p>68:16 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.</p>
<p>68:17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.</p>
<p>68:18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.</p>
<p>68:19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.</p>
<p>68:20 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.</p>
<p>68:21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.</p>
<p>68:22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:</p>
<p>68:23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.</p>
<p>68:24 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>68:25 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.</p>
<p>68:26 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.</p>
<p>68:27 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.</p>
<p>68:28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.</p>
<p>68:29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.</p>
<p>68:30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.</p>
<p>68:31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.</p>
<p>68:32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:</p>
<p>68:33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.</p>
<p>68:34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.</p>
<p>68:35 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.</p>
<p>69:1 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.</p>
<p>69:2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</p>
<p>69:3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</p>
<p>69:4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.</p>
<p>69:5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</p>
<p>69:6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</p>
<p>69:7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</p>
<p>69:8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.</p>
<p>69:9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</p>
<p>69:10 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</p>
<p>69:11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</p>
<p>69:12 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.</p>
<p>69:13 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</p>
<p>69:14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>
<p>69:15 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</p>
<p>69:16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>
<p>69:17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</p>
<p>69:18 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</p>
<p>69:19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.</p>
<p>69:20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.</p>
<p>69:21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>
<p>69:22 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.</p>
<p>69:23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</p>
<p>69:24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>
<p>69:25 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.</p>
<p>69:26 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</p>
<p>69:27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</p>
<p>69:28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</p>
<p>69:29 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</p>
<p>69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>
<p>69:31 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</p>
<p>69:32 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.</p>
<p>69:33 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</p>
<p>69:34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</p>
<p>69:35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</p>
<p>69:36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</p>
<p>70:1 Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord.</p>
<p>70:2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.</p>
<p>70:3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.</p>
<p>70:4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.</p>
<p>70:5 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.</p>
<p>71:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.</p>
<p>71:2 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.</p>
<p>71:3 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.</p>
<p>71:4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</p>
<p>71:5 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.</p>
<p>71:6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.</p>
<p>71:7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.</p>
<p>71:8 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.</p>
<p>71:9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.</p>
<p>71:10 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,</p>
<p>71:11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.</p>
<p>71:12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.</p>
<p>71:13 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.</p>
<p>71:14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.</p>
<p>71:15 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.</p>
<p>71:16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.</p>
<p>71:17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.</p>
<p>71:18 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.</p>
<p>71:19 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!</p>
<p>71:20 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.</p>
<p>71:21 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.</p>
<p>71:22 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>71:23 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.</p>
<p>71:24 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.</p>
<p>72:1 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son.</p>
<p>72:2 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.</p>
<p>72:3 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.</p>
<p>72:4 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.</p>
<p>72:5 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.</p>
<p>72:6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.</p>
<p>72:7 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.</p>
<p>72:8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>72:9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.</p>
<p>72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.</p>
<p>72:11 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.</p>
<p>72:12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.</p>
<p>72:13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.</p>
<p>72:14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.</p>
<p>72:15 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.</p>
<p>72:16 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.</p>
<p>72:17 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.</p>
<p>72:18 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.</p>
<p>72:19 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.</p>
<p>72:20 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.</p>
<p>73:1 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.</p>
<p>73:2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</p>
<p>73:3 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p>
<p>73:4 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.</p>
<p>73:5 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.</p>
<p>73:6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.</p>
<p>73:7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</p>
<p>73:8 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.</p>
<p>73:9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</p>
<p>73:10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.</p>
<p>73:11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</p>
<p>73:12 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.</p>
<p>73:13 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</p>
<p>73:14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</p>
<p>73:15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.</p>
<p>73:16 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;</p>
<p>73:17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.</p>
<p>73:18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</p>
<p>73:19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</p>
<p>73:20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</p>
<p>73:21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</p>
<p>73:22 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.</p>
<p>73:23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.</p>
<p>73:24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.</p>
<p>73:25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.</p>
<p>73:26 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</p>
<p>73:27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</p>
<p>73:28 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</p>
