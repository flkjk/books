<p><br/></p>
<p>We were still discussing this and other matters when the sea grew rough, and clouds, gathering from every quarter, obscured with darkness the light of day. The panic- stricken sailors ran to their stations and took in sail before the squall was upon them, but the gale did not drive the waves in any one direction and the helmsman lost his bearings and did not know what course to steer. At one moment the wind would set towards Sicily, but the next, the North Wind, prevailing on the Italian coast, would drive the unlucky vessel hither and yon; and, what was more dangerous than all the rain-squalls, a pall of such black density blotted out the light that the helmsman could not even see as far forward as the bow. At last, as the savage fury of the sea grew more malignant, the trembling Lycas stretched out his hands to me imploringly. “Save us from destruction, Encolpius,” he shouted; “restore that sacred robe and holy rattle to the ship! Be merciful, for heaven’s sake, just as you used to be!” He was still shouting when a windsquall swept him into the sea; the raging elements whirled him around and around in a terrible maelstrom and sucked him down. Tryphaena, on the other hand, was seized by her faithful servants, placed in a skiff, along with the greater part of her belongings, and saved from certain death. Embracing Giton, I wept aloud: “Did we deserve this from the gods,” I cried, “to be united only in death? No! Malignant fortune grudges even that. Look! In an instant the waves will capsize the ship! Think! In an instant the sea will sever this lover’s embrace! If you ever loved Encolpius truly, kiss him while yet you may and snatch this last delight from impending dissolution!” Even as I was speaking, Giton removed his garment and, creeping beneath my tunic, he stuck out his head to be kissed; then, fearing some more spiteful wave might separate us as we clung together, he passed his belt around us both. “If nothing else,” he cried, “the sea will at least bear us longer, joined together, and if, in pity, it casts us up upon the same shore, some passerby may pile some stones over us, out of common human kindness, or the last rites will be performed by the drifting sand, in spite of the angry waves.” I submit to this last bond and, as though I were laid out upon my death-bed, await an end no longer dreaded. Meanwhile, accomplishing the decrees of the Fates, the storm stripped the ship of all that was left; no mast, no helm, not a rope nor an oar remained on board her; she was only a derelict, heavy and water-logged, drifting before the waves. Some fishermen hastily put off in their little boats to salvage their booty, but, seeing men alive and ready to defend their property, they changed their predatory designs into offers of help.<br/>

<p>Just then, amid that clamor of voices we heard a peculiar noise, and from beneath the captain’s cabin there came a bellowing as of some wild beast trying to get out. We then followed up the sound and discovered Eumolpus, sitting there scribbling verses upon an immense sheet of parchment! Astounded that he could find time to write poetry at death’s very door, we hauled him out, in spite of his protests, and ordered him to return to his senses, but he flew into a rage at being interrupted; “Leave me alone until I finish this sentence,” he bawled; “the poem labors to its birth.” Ordering Giton to come to close quarters and help me drag the bellowing bard ashore, I laid hands upon the lunatic. When this job had at last been completed, we came, wet and wretched, to a fisherman’s hut and refreshed ourselves somewhat with stores from the wreck, spoiled though they were by salt water, and passed a night that was almost interminable. As we were holding a council, next day, to determine to what part of the country we had best proceed, I suddenly caught sight of a human body, turning around in a gentle eddy and floating towards the shore. Stricken with melancholy, I stood still and began to brood, with wet eyes, upon the treachery of the sea. “And perhaps,” said I, “a wife, safe in some far-away country of the earth, awaits this man, or a son who little dreams of storms or wrecks; or perhaps he left behind a father, whom he kissed good-by at parting! Such is the end of mortal’s plans, such is the outcome of great ambitions! See how man rides the waves!” Until now, I had been sorrowing for a mere stranger, but a wave turned the face, which had undergone no change, towards the shore, and I recognized Lycas; so evil- tempered and so unrelenting but a short time before, now cast up almost at my feet! I could no longer restrain the tears, at this; I beat my breast again and yet again, with my hands. “Where is your evil temper now?” I cried. “Where is your unbridled passion? You be there, a prey to fish and wild beasts, you who boasted but a little while ago of the strength of your command. Now you have not a single plank left of your great ship! Go on, mortals; set your hearts upon the fulfillment of great ambitions: Go on, schemers, and in your wills control for a thousand years the disposal of the wealth you got by fraud! Only yesterday this man audited the accounts of his family estate, yea, even reckoned the day he would arrive in his native land and settled it in his mind! Gods and goddesses, how far he lies from his appointed destination! But the waves of the sea are not alone in thus keeping faith with mortal men: The warrior’s weapons fail him; the citizen is buried beneath the ruins of his own penates, when engaged in paying his vows to the gods; another falls from his chariot and dashes out his ardent spirit; the glutton chokes at dinner; the niggard starves from abstinence. Give the dice a fair throw and you will find shipwreck everywhere! Ah, but one overwhelmed by the waves obtains no burial! As though it matters in what manner the body, once it is dead, is consumed: by fire, by flood, by time! Do what you will, these all achieve the same end. Ah, but the beasts will mangle the body! As though fire would deal with it any more gently; when we are angry with our slaves that is the punishment which we consider the most severe. What folly it is, then, to do everything we can to prevent the grave from leaving any part of us behind {when the Fates will look out for us, event against our wills.} (After these reflections we made ready to pay the last rites to the corpse,) and Lycas was burned upon a funeral pyre raised by the hands of enemies, while Eumolpus, fixing his eyes upon the far distance to gain inspiration, composed an epitaph for the dead man:</p>
<p>HIS FATE WAS UNAVOIDABLE</p>
<p>NO ROCK-HEWN TOMB NOR SCULPTURED MARBLE HIS,</p>
<p>HIS NOBLE CORPSE FIVE FEET OF EARTH RECEIVED,</p>
<p>HE RESTS IN PEACE BENEATH THIS HUMBLE MOUND.<br/>

<p>We set out upon our intended journey, after this last office had been wholeheartedly performed, and, in a little while, arrived, sweating, at the top of a mountain, from which we made out, at no great distance, a town, perched upon the summit of a lofty eminence. Wanderers as we were, we had no idea what town it could be, until we learned from a caretaker that it was Crotona, a very ancient city, and once the first in Italy. When we earnestly inquired, upon learning this, what men inhabited such historic ground, and the nature of the business in which they were principally engaged, now that their wealth had been dissipated by the oft recurring wars, “My friends,” replied he, “if you are men of business, change your plans and seek out some other conservative road to a livelihood, but if you can play the part of men of great culture, always ready with a lie, you are on the straight road to riches: The study of literature is held in no estimation in that city, eloquence has no niche there, economy and decent standards of morality come into no reward of honor there; you must know that every man whom you will meet in that city belongs to one of two factions; they either ‘take-in,’ or else they are ‘taken-in.’ No one brings up children in that city, for the reason that no one who has heirs is invited to dinner or admitted to the games; such an one is deprived of all enjoyments and must lurk with the rabble. On the other hand, those who have never married a wife, or those who have no near relatives, attain to the very highest honors; in other words, they are the only ones who are considered soldierly, or the bravest of the brave, or even good. You will see a town which resembles the fields in time of pestilence,” he continued, “in which there is nothing but carcasses to be torn at and carrion crows tearing at them.”<br/>

<p>Eumolpus, who had a deeper insight, turned this state of affairs over in his mind and declared that he was not displeased with a prospect of that kind. I thought the old fellow was joking in the care-free way of poets, until he complained, “If I could only put up a better front! I mean that I wish my clothing was in better taste, that my jewelry was more expensive; all this would lend color to my deception: I would not carry this scrip, by Hercules, I would not I would lead you all to great riches!” For my part, I undertook to supply whatever my companion in robbery had need of, provided he would be satisfied with the garment, and with whatever spoils the villa of Lycurgus had yielded when we robbed it; as for money against present needs, the Mother of the Gods would see to that, out of regard to her own good name! “Well, what’s to prevent our putting on an extravaganza?” demanded Eumolpus. “Make me the master if the business appeals to you.” No one ventured to condemn a scheme by which he could lose nothing, and so, that the lie would be kept safe among us all, we swore a solemn oath, the words of which were dictated by Eumolpus, to endure fire, chains, flogging, death by the sword, and whatever else Eumolpus might demand of us, just like regular gladiators! After the oath had been taken, we paid our respects to our master with pretended servility, and were informed that Eumolpus had lost a son, a young man of great eloquence and promise, and that it was for this reason the poor old man had left his native land that he might not see the companions and clients of his son, nor even his tomb, which was the cause of his daily tears. To this misfortune a recent shipwreck had been added, in which he had lost upwards of two millions of sesterces; not that he minded the loss but, destitute of a train of servants he could not keep up his proper dignity! Furthermore, he had, invested in Africa, thirty millions of sesterces in estates and bonds; such a horde of his slaves was scattered over the fields of Numidia that he could have even sacked Carthage! We demanded that Eumolpus cough frequently, to further this scheme, that he have trouble with his stomach and find fault with all the food when in company, that he keep talking of gold and silver and estates, the incomes from which were not what they should be, and of the everlasting unproductiveness of the soil; that he cast up his accounts daily, that he revise the terms of his will monthly, and, for fear any detail should be lacking to make the farce complete, he was to use the wrong names whenever he wished to summon any of us, so that it would be plain to all that the master had in mind some who were not present. When everything had been thus provided for, we offered a prayer to the gods “that the matter might turn out well and happily,” and took to the road. But Giton could not bear up under his unaccustomed load, and the hired servant Corax, a shirker of work, often put down his own load and cursed our haste, swearing that he would either throw his packs away or run away with his load. “What do you take me for, a beast of burden?” he grumbled, “or a scow for carrying stone? I hired out to do the work of a man, not that of a pack-horse, and I’m as free as you are, even if my father did leave me poor!” Not satisfied with swearing, he lifted up his leg from time to time and filled the road with an obscene noise and a filthy stench. Giton laughed at his impudence and imitated every explosion with his lips, {but Eumolpus relapsed into his usual vein, even in spite of this.}<br/>

<p>“Young men,” said he, “many are they who have been seduced by poetry; for, the instant a man has composed a verse in feet, and has woven a more delicate meaning into it by means of circumlocutions, he straightway concludes that he has scaled Helicon! Take those who are worn out by the distressing detail of the legal profession, for example: they often seek sanctuary in the tranquillity of poetry, as a more sheltered haven, believing themselves able more easily to compose a poem than a rebuttal charged with scintillating epigrams! But a more highly cultivated mind loves not this conceited affectation, nor can it either conceive or bring forth, unless it has been steeped in the vast flood of literature. Every word that is what I would call ‘low,’ ought to be avoided, and phrases far removed from plebeian usage should be chosen. Let ‘Ye rabble rout avaunt,’ be your rule. In addition, care should be exercised in preventing the epigrams from standing out from the body of the speech; they should gleam with the brilliancy woven into the fabric. Homer is an example, and the lyric poets, and our Roman Virgil, and the exquisite propriety of Horace. Either the others did not discover the road that leads to poetry, or, having seen, they feared to tread it. Whoever attempts that mighty theme, the civil war, for instance, will sink under the load unless he is saturated with literature. Events, past and passing, ought not to be merely recorded in verse, the historian will deal with them far better; by means of circumlocutions and the intervention of the immortals, the free spirit, wracked by the search for epigrams having a mythological illusion, should plunge headlong and appear as the prophecy of a mind inspired rather than the attested faith of scrupulous exactitude in speech. This hasty composition may please you, even though it has not yet received its final polishing:”<br/>

“The conquering Roman now held the whole world in his sway,<br/>
The ocean, the land; where the sun shone by day or the moon<br/>
Gleamed by night: but unsated was he. And the seas<br/>
Were roiled by the weight of his deep-laden keels; if a bay<br/>
Lay hidden beyond, or a land which might yield yellow gold<br/>
‘Twas held as a foe. While the struggle for treasure went on<br/>
The fates were preparing the horrors and scourges of war.<br/>
Amusements enjoyed by the vulgar no longer can charm<br/>
Nor pleasures worn threadbare by use of the plebeian mob.<br/>
The bronzes of Corinth are praised by the soldier at sea;<br/>
And glittering gems sought in earth, vie with purple of Tyre;<br/>
Numidia curses her here, there, the exquisite silks<br/>
Of China; Arabia’s people have stripped their own fields.<br/>
Behold other woes and calamities outraging peace!<br/>
Wild beasts, in the forest are hunted, for gold; and remote<br/>
African hammon is covered by beaters, for fear<br/>
Some beast that slays men with his teeth shall escape, for by that<br/>
His value to men is enhanced! The vessels receive<br/>
Strange ravening monsters; the tiger behind gilded bars<br/>
And pacing his cage is transported to Rome, that his jaws<br/>
May drip with the life blood of men to the plaudits of men<br/>
Oh shame! To point out our impending destruction; the crime<br/>
Of Persia enacted anew; in his puberty’s bloom<br/>
The man child is kidnapped; surrenders his powers to the knife,<br/>
Is forced to the calling of Venus; delayed and hedged round<br/>
The hurrying passage of life’s finest years is held back<br/>
And Nature seeks Nature but finds herself not. Everywhere<br/>
These frail-limbed and mincing effeminates, flowing of locks,<br/>
Bedecked with an infinite number of garments of silk<br/>
Whose names ever change, the wantons and lechers to snare,<br/>
Are eagerly welcomed! From African soil now behold<br/>
The citron-wood tables; their well-burnished surface reflects<br/>
Our Tyrian purples and slaves by the horde, and whose spots<br/>
Resemble the gold that is cheaper than they and ensnare<br/>
Extravagance. Sterile and ignobly prized is the wood<br/>
But round it is gathered a company sodden with wine;<br/>
And soldiers of fortune whose weapons have rusted, devour<br/>
The spoils of the world. Art caters to appetite. Wrasse<br/>
From Sicily brought to their table, alive in his own Sea water.<br/>
The oysters from Lucrine’s shore torn, at the feast<br/>
Are served to make famous the host; and the appetite, cloyed,<br/>
To tempt by extravagance. Phasis has now been despoiled<br/>
Of birds, its littoral silent, no sound there is heard<br/>
Save only the wind as it rustles among the last leaves.<br/>
Corruption no less vile is seen in the campus of Mars,<br/>
Our quirites are bribed; and for plunder and promise of gain<br/>
Their votes they will alter. The people is venal; corrupt<br/>
The Senate; support has its price! And the freedom and worth<br/>
Of age is decayed, scattered largesse now governs their power;<br/>
Corrupted by gold, even dignity lies in the dust.<br/>
Cato defeated and hooted by mobs, but the victor<br/>
Is sadder, ashamed to have taken the rods from a Cato:<br/>
In this lay the shame of the nation and character’s downfall,<br/>
‘Twas not the defeat of a man! No! The power and the glory<br/>
Of Rome were brought low; represented in him was the honor<br/>
Of sturdy Republican Rome. So, abandoned and wretched,<br/>
The city has purchased dishonor: has purchased herself!<br/>
Despoiled by herself, no avenger to wipe out the stigma<br/>
Twin maelstroms of debt and of usury suck down the commons.<br/>
No home with clear title, no citizen free from a mortgage,<br/>
But as some slow wasting disease all unheralded fastens<br/>
Its hold on the vitals, destroying the vigor of manhood,<br/>
So, fear of the evils impending, impels them to madness.<br/>
Despair turns to violence, luxury’s ravages needs must<br/>
Repaired be by bloodshed, for indigence safely can venture.<br/>
Can art or sane reason rouse wallowing Rome from the offal<br/>
And break the voluptuous slumber in which she is sunken?<br/>
Or must it be fury and war and the blood-lust of daggers?”</p>

“Three chieftains did fortune bring forth, whom the fury of battles<br/>
Destroyed; and interred, each one under a mountain of weapons;<br/>
The Parthian has Crassus, Pompeius the Great by the waters<br/>
Of Egypt lies. Julius, ungrateful Rome stained with his life blood.<br/>
And earth has divided their ashes, unable to suffer<br/>
The weight of so many tombs. These are the wages of glory!<br/>
There lies between Naples and Great Puteoli, a chasm<br/>
Deep cloven, and Cocytus churns there his current; the vapor<br/>
In fury escapes from the gorge with that lethal spray laden.<br/>
No green in the aututun is there, no grass gladdens the meadow,<br/>
The supple twigs never resound with the twittering singing<br/>
Of birds in the Springtime. But chaos, volcanic black boulders<br/>
Of pumice lie Happy within their drear setting of cypress.<br/>
Amidst these infernal surroundings the ruler of Hades<br/>
Uplifted his head by the funeral flames silhouetted<br/>
And sprinkled with white from the ashes of corpses; and challenged<br/>
Winged Fortune in words such as these: ‘Oh thou fickle controller<br/>
Of things upon earth and in heaven, security’s foeman,<br/>
Oh Chance! Oh thou lover eternally faithful to change, and<br/>
Possession’s betrayer, dost own thyself crushed by the power<br/>
Of Rome? Canst not raise up the tottering mass to its downfall<br/>
Its strength the young manhood of Rome now despises, and staggers<br/>
In bearing the booty heaped up by its efforts: behold how<br/>
They lavish their spoils! Wealth run mad now brings down their destruction.<br/>
They build out of gold and their palaces reach to the heavens;<br/>
The sea is expelled by their moles and their pastures are oceans;<br/>
They war against Nature in changing the state of creation.<br/>
They threaten my kingdom! Earth yawns with their tunnels deep driven<br/>
To furnish the stone for their madmen’s foundations; already<br/>
The mountains are hollowed and now but re-echoing caverns;<br/>
While man quarries marble to serve his vainglorious purpose<br/>
The spirits infernal confess that they hope to win Heaven!<br/>
Arise, then, O Chance, change thy countenance peaceful to warlike<br/>
And harry the Romans, consign to my kingdom the fallen.<br/>
Ah, long is it now since my lips were with blood cooled and moistened,<br/>
Nor has my Tisiphone bathed her blood-lusting body<br/>
Since Sulla’s sword drank to repletion and earth’s bristling harvest<br/>
Grew ripe upon blood and thrust up to the light of the sunshine!’”</p>

Bright flash of Jove’s lightning transfixed them with flame and was gone.<br/>
The Lord of the Shades blanched with fear, at this bolt of his brother’s,<br/>
Sank back, and drew closely together the gorge in Earth’s bosom.<br/>
By auspices straightway the slaughter of men and the evils<br/>
Impending are shown by the gods. Here, the Titan unsightly<br/>

Already he gazed, thou hadst thought! There, silvery Cynthia<br/>
Obscuring her face at the full, denied light to the outrage.<br/>

And wandering rivers, to rivulets shrunk, writhed no longer<br/>

Appear midst the tombs and unburied bones, gibbering menace<br/>

Forsook vacillation and, spurred by the love of revenge, sheathed<br/>

There, high in the Alps, where the crags, by a Greek god once trodden,<br/>
Slope down and permit of approach, is a spot ever sacred<br/>

And rears to the heavens a summit eternally hoary,<br/>
As though the sky there had slipped down: no warmth from the sunbeams,<br/>
No breath from the Springtime can soften the pile’s wintry rigor<br/>
Nor slacken the frost chains that bind; and its menacing shoulders<br/>
The weight of the world could sustain. With victorious legions<br/>
These crests Caesar trod and selected a camp. Gazing downwards<br/>
On Italy’s plains rolling far, from the top of the mountain,<br/>
He lifted both hands to the heavens, his voice rose in prayer:<br/>
‘Omnipotent Jove, and thou, refuge of Saturn whose glory<br/>
Was brightened by feats of my armies and crowned with my triumphs,<br/>
Bear witness! Unwillingly summon I Mars to these armies,<br/>
Unwillingly draw I the sword! But injustice compels me.<br/>
While enemy blood dyes the Rhine and the Alps are held firmly<br/>
Repulsing a second assault of the Gauls on our city,<br/>
She dubs me an outcast! And Victory makes me an exile!<br/>
To triumphs three score, and defeats of the Germans, my treason<br/>
I trace! How can they fear my glory or see in my battles<br/>
A menace? But hirelings, and vile, to whom my Rome is but a<br/>
Stepmother! Methinks that no craven this sword arm shall hamper<br/>
And take not a stroke in repost. On to victory, comrades,<br/>
While anger seethes hot. With the sword we will seek a decision<br/>
The doom lowering down is a peril to all, and the treason.<br/>
My gratitude owe I to you, not alone have I conquered!<br/>
Since punishment waits by our trophies and victory merits<br/>
Disgrace, then let Chance cast the lots. Raise the standard of battle;<br/>
Again take your swords. Well I know that my cause is accomplished<br/>
Amidst such armed warriors I know that I cannot be beaten.’<br/>
While yet the words echoed, from heaven the bird of Apollo<br/>
Vouchsafed a good omen and beat with his pinions the ether.<br/>
From out of the left of a gloomy grove strange voices sounded<br/>
And flame flashed thereafter! The sun gleamed with brighter refulgence<br/>
Unwonted, his face in a halo of golden flame shining.”</p>

“By omens emboldened, to follow, the battle-flags, Caesar<br/>
Commanded; and boldly led on down the perilous pathway.<br/>
The footing, firm-fettered by frost chains and ice, did not hinder<br/>
At first, but lay silent, the kindly cold masking its grimness;<br/>

Amphitryon’s offspring came striding the Caucasus slopes down;<br/>
Or Jupiter’s menacing mien as, from lofty Olympus<br/>
He leaped, the doomed giants to crush and to scatter their weapons.<br/>
While Caesar in anger the swelling peaks treads down, winged rumor<br/>
In terror flies forth and on beating wings seeks the high summit<br/>
Of Palatine tall: every image she rocks with her message<br/>
Announcing this thunderbolt Roman! Already, the ocean<br/>
Is tossing his fleets! Now his cavalry, reeking with German<br/>
Gore, pours from the Alps! Slaughter, bloodshed, and weapons<br/>
The red panorama of war is unrolled to their vision!<br/>
By terror their hearts are divided: two counsels perplex them!<br/>
One chooses by land to seek flight: to another, the water<br/>
Appeals, and the sea than his own land is safer! Another<br/>
Will stand to his arms and advantage extort from Fate’s mandate.<br/>
The depth of their fear marks the length of their flight! In confusion<br/>
The people itself--shameful spectacle--driven by terror<br/>
Is led to abandon the city. Rome glories in fleeing!<br/>
The Quirites from battle blench! Cowed by the breath of a rumor<br/>
Relinquished their firesides to mourning! One citizen, palsied<br/>
With terror, his children embraces: another, his penates<br/>
Conceals in his bosom; then, weeping, takes leave of his threshold<br/>
And slaughters the distant invader--with curses! Their spouses<br/>
Some clasp to their sorrow-wracked bosoms! Youths carry their fathers<br/>
Bowed down with old age, uninured to the bearing of burdens.<br/>
They seize what they dread to lose most. Inexperience drags all<br/>
Its chattels to camp and to battle: as, when powerful Auster<br/>
Piles up the churned waters and tumbles them: never a yard-arm<br/>
Nor rudder to answer the hand, here, one fashions a life-raft<br/>
Of pine planks, another steers into some bay on a lee shore,<br/>
Another will crack on and run from the gale and to Fortune<br/>
Trust all! But why sorrow for trifles? The consuls, with Pompey<br/>
The Great--he, the terror of Pontus, of savage Hydaspes<br/>
Explorer, the reef that wrecked pirates, caused Jove to turn livid,<br/>
When thrice was a triumph decreed him, whom Pontus’ vexed water<br/>
And pacified billows of Bosphorus worshipped! Disgraceful their<br/>
Flight! Title and glory forsaking! Now Fortune capricious<br/>
Looks down on the back of great Pompey retreating in terror!”</p>

<p><br/>
“So great a misfortune disrupted the concord of heaven<br/>
And gods swelled the rout in their panic! Behold through creation<br/>
The gentle divinities flee from the ravening earth; in<br/>
Their loathing they turn from humanity, doomed to destruction!<br/>
And first of all, Peace, with her snowy white arms, hides her visage<br/>
Defeated, her helmet beneath and, abandoning earth, flees<br/>
To seek out the realm of implacable Dis, as a refuge<br/>
Meek Faith her companion, and Justice with locks loosely flowing,<br/>
And Concord, in tears, and her raiment in tatters, attend her.<br/>
The minions of Pluto pour forth from the portals of darkness<br/>
That yawn: the serpent-haired Fury, Bellona the Savage,<br/>
Megoera with firebrands, destruction, and treachery, livid<br/>
Death’s likeness! Among them is Frenzy, as, free, with her lashings<br/>
Snapped short, she now raises her gory head, shielding her features<br/>
Deep scarred by innumerous wounds ‘neath her helmet blood-clotted.<br/>
Her left arm she guards with a battle-scarred shield scored by weapons,<br/>
And numberless spear-heads protrude from its surface: her right hand<br/>
A flaming torch brandishes, kindling a flame that will burn up<br/>
The world! Now the gods are on earth and the skies note their absence;<br/>
The planets disordered their orbits attempt! Into factions<br/>
The heavens divide; first Dione espouses the cause of<br/>
Her Caesar. Minerva next steps to her side and the great son<br/>
Of Ares, his mighty spear brandishing! Phoebus espouses<br/>
The cause of Great Pompey: his sister and Mercury also<br/>
And Hercules like unto him in his travels and labors.<br/>
The trumpets call! Discord her Stygian head lifts to heaven<br/>
Her tresses disheveled, her features with clotted blood covered,<br/>
Tears pour from her bruised eyes, her iron fangs thick coated with rust,<br/>
Her tongue distils poison, her features are haloed with serpents,<br/>
Her hideous bosom is visible under her tatters,<br/>
A torch with a blood red flame waves from her tremulous right hand.<br/>
Emerging from Cocytus dark and from Tartarus murky<br/>
She strode to the crests of the Apennines noble, the prospect<br/>
Of earth to survey, spread before her the world panorama<br/>
Its shores and the armies that march on its surface: these words then<br/>
Burst out of her bosom malignant: ‘To arms, now, ye nations,<br/>
While anger seethes hot, seize your arms, set the torch to the cities,<br/>
Who skulks now is lost; neither woman nor child nor the aged<br/>
Bowed down with their years shall find quarter: the whole world will tremble<br/>
And rooftrees themselves shall crash down and take part in the struggle.<br/>
Marcellus, hold firm for the law! And thou, Curio, madden<br/>
The rabble! Thou, Lentulus, strive not to check valiant Ares!<br/>
Thou, Cesar divine, why delayest thou now thine invasion?<br/>
Why smash not the gates, why not level the walls of the cities,<br/>
Their treasures to pillage? Thou, Magnus, dost not know the secret<br/>
Of holding the hills of Rome? Take thou the walls of Dyrrachium,<br/>
Let Thessaly’s harbors be dyed with the blood of the Romans!’<br/>
On earth was obeyed every detail of Discord’s commandment.”</p>

<p>When Eumolpus had, with great volubility, poured out this flood of words, we came at last to Crotona. Here we refreshed ourselves at a mean inn, but on the following day we went in search of more imposing lodgings and fell in with a crowd of legacy hunters who were very curious as to the class of society to which we belonged and as to whence we had come. Thereupon, in accord with our mutual understanding, such ready answers did we make as to who we might be or whence we had come that we gave them no cause for doubt. They immediately fell to wrangling in their desire to heap their own riches upon Eumolpus and every fortune-hunter solicited his favor with presents.<br/>

<p><br/></p>
<p>For a long time affairs at Crotona ran along in this manner and Eumolpus, flushed with success so far forgot the former state of his fortunes that he even bragged to his followers that no one could hold out against any wish of his, and that any member of his suite who committed a crime in that city would, through the influence of his friends, get off unpunished. But, although I daily crammed my bloated carcass to overflowing with good things, and began more and more to believe that Fortune had turned away her face from keeping watch upon me, I frequently meditated, nevertheless, upon my present state and upon its cause. “Suppose,” thought I, “some wily legacy hunter should dispatch an agent to Africa and catch us in our lie? Or even suppose the hireling servant, glutted with prosperity, should tip off his cronies or give the whole scheme away out of spite? There would be nothing for it but flight and, in a fresh state of destitution, a recalling of poverty which had been driven off. Gods and goddesses, how ill it fares with those living outside the law; they are always on the lookout for what is coming to them!” (Turning these possibilities over in my mind I left the house, in a state of black melancholy, hoping to revive my spirits in the fresh air, but scarcely had I set foot upon the public promenade when a girl, by no means homely, met me, and, calling me Polyaenos, the name I had assumed since my metamorphosis, informed me that her mistress desired leave to speak with me. “You must be mistaken,” I answered, in confusion, “I am only a servant and a stranger, and am by no means worthy of such an honor.”)<br/>

<p>(“You yourself,” she replied, “are the one to whom I was sent but,) because you are well aware of your good looks, you are proud and sell your favors instead of giving them. What else can those wavy well-combed locks mean or that face, rouged and covered with cosmetics, or that languishing, wanton expression in your eyes? Why that gait, so precise that not a footstep deviates from its place, unless you wish to show off your figure in order to sell your favors? Look at me, I know nothing about omens and I don’t study the heavens like the astrologers, but I can read men’s intentions in their faces and I know what a flirt is after when I see him out for a stroll; so if you’ll sell us what I want there’s a buyer ready, but if you will do the graceful thing and lend, let us be under obligations to you for the favor. And as for your confession that you are only a common servant, by that you only fan the passion of the lady who burns for you, for some women will only kindle for canaille and cannot work up an appetite unless they see some slave or runner with his clothing girded up: a gladiator arouses one, or a mule-driver all covered with dust, or some actor posturing in some exhibition on the stage. My mistress belongs to this class, she jumps the fourteen rows from the stage to the gallery and looks for a lover among the gallery gods at the back.” Puffed up with this delightful chatter. “Come now, confess, won’t you,” I queried, “is this lady who loves me yourself?” The waiting maid smiled broadly at this blunt speech. “Don’t have such a high opinion of yourself,” said she, “I’ve never given in to any servant yet; the gods forbid that I should ever throw my arms around a gallows-bird. Let the married women see to that and kiss the marks of the scourge if they like: I’ll sit upon nothing below a knight, even if I am only a servant.” I could not help marveling, for my part, at such discordant passions, and I thought it nothing short of a miracle that this servant should possess the hauteur of the mistress and the mistress the low tastes of the wench!</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><br/>
Each one will find what suits his taste, one thing is not for all,<br/>
One gathers roses as his share, another thorns enthrall.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After a little more teasing, I requested the maid to conduct her mistress to a clump of plane trees. Pleased with this plan, the girl picked up the skirt of her garment and turned into a laurel grove that bordered the path. After a short delay she brought her mistress from her hiding-place and conducted her to my side; a woman more perfect than any statue. There are no words with which to describe her form and anything I could say would fall far short. Her hair, naturally wavy, flowed completely over her shoulders; her forehead was low and the roots of her hair were brushed back from it; her eyebrows, running from the very springs of her cheeks, almost met at the boundary line between a pair of eyes brighter than stars shining in a moonless night; her nose was slightly aquiline and her mouth was such an one as Praxiteles dreamed Diana had. Her chin, her neck, her hands, the gleaming whiteness of her feet under a slender band of gold; she turned Parian marble dull! Then, for the first time, Doris’ tried lover thought lightly of Doris!</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><br/>
Oh Jove, what’s come to pass that thou, thine armor cast away<br/>
Art mute in heaven; and but an idle tale?<br/>
At such a time the horns should sprout, the raging bull hold sway,<br/>
Or they white hair beneath swan’s down conceal<br/>
Here’s Dana’s self! But touch that lovely form<br/>
Thy limbs will melt beneath thy passions’ storm!</p>

<p>She was delighted and so be witchingly did she smile that I seemed to see the full moon showing her face from behind a cloud. Then, punctuating her words with her fingers, “Dear boy, if you are not too critical to enjoy a woman of wealth who has but this year known her first man, I offer you a sister,” said she. “You have a brother already, I know, for I didn’t disdain to ask, but what is to prevent your adopting a sister, too? I will come in on the same footing only deem my kisses worthy of recognition and caress me at your own pleasure!” “Rather let me implore you by your beauty,” I replied. “Do not scorn to admit an alien among your worshipers: If you permit me to kneel before your shrine you will find me a true votary and, that you may not think I approach this temple of love without a gift, I make you a present of my brother!” “What,” she exclaimed, “would you really sacrifice the only one without whom you. could not live’? The one upon whose kisses your happiness depends. Him whom you love as I would have you love me?” Such sweetness permeated her voice as she said this, so entrancing was the sound upon the listening air that you would have believed the Sirens’ harmonies were floating in the breeze. I was struck with wonder and dazzled by I know not what light that shone upon me, brighter than, the whole heaven, but I made bold to inquire the name of my divinity. “Why, didn’t my maid tell you that I am called Circe?” she replied. “But I am not the sun-child nor has my mother ever stayed the revolving world in its course at her pleasure; but if the Fates bring us two together I will owe heaven a favor. I don’t know what it is, but some god’s silent purpose is beneath this. Circe loves not Polyaenos without some reason; a great torch is always flaming when these names meet! Take me in your arms then, if you will; there’s no prying stranger to fear, and your ‘brother’ is far away from this spot!” So saying, Circe clasped me in arms that were softer than down and drew me to the ground which was covered with colored flowers.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><br/>
With flowers like these did Mother Earth great Ida’s summit strew<br/>
When Jupiter, his heart aflame, enjoyed his lawful love;<br/>
There glowed the rose, the flowering rush, the violet’s deep blue,<br/>
From out green meadows snow-white lilies laughed. Then from above,<br/>
This setting summoned Venus to the green and tender sod,<br/>
Bright day smiled kindly on the secret amour of the God.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Side by side upon the grassy plot we lay, exchanging a thousand kisses, the prelude to more poignant pleasure, (but alas! My sudden loss of vigor disappointed Circe!)<br/>

<p>(Infuriated at this affront,) “What’s the matter,” demanded she; “do my kisses offend you? Is my breath fetid from fasting? Is there any evil smelling perspiration in my armpits? Or, if it’s nothing of this kind, are you afraid of Giton?” Under her eyes, I flushed hotly and, if I had any virility left, I lost it then; my whole body seemed to be inert. “My queen,” I cried, “do not mock me in my humiliation. I am bewitched!” (Circe’s anger was far from being appeased by such a trivial excuse; turning her eyes contemptuously away from me, she looked at her maid,) “Tell me, Chrysis, and tell me truly, is there anything repulsive about me? Anything sluttish? Have I some natural blemish that disfigures my beauty? Don’t deceive your mistress! I don’t know what’s the matter with us, but there must be something!” Then she snatched a mirror from the silent maid and after scrutinizing all the looks and smiles which pass between lovers, she shook out her wrinkled earth-stained robe and flounced off into the temple of Venus (nearby.) And here was I, like a convicted criminal who had seen some horrible nightmare, asking myself whether the pleasure out of which I had been cheated was a reality or only a dream.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><br/>
As when, in the sleep-bringing night<br/>
Dreams sport with the wandering eyes,<br/>
And earth, spaded up, yields to light<br/>
Her gold that by day she denies,<br/>
The stealthy hand snatches the spoils;<br/>
The face with cold sweat is suffused<br/>
And Fear grips him tight in her toils<br/>
Lest robbers the secret have used<br/>
And shake out the gold from his breast.<br/>
But, when they depart from his brain,<br/>
These enchantments by which he’s obsessed,<br/>
And Truth comes again with her train<br/>
Restoring perspective and pain,<br/>
The phantasm lives to the last,<br/>
The mind dwells with shades of the past.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>(The misfortune seemed to me a dream, but I imagined that I must surely be under a spell of enchantment and, for a long time, I was so devoid of strength that I could not get to my feet. But finally my mental depression began to abate, little by little my strength came back to me, and I returned home: arrived there, I feigned illness and threw myself upon my couch. A little late: Giton, who had heard of my indisposition, entered the room in some concern. As I wished to relieve his mind I informed him that I had merely sought my pallet to take a rest, telling him much other gossip but not a word about my mishap as I stood in great fear of his jealousy and, to lull any suspicion which he might entertain, I drew him to my side and endeavoured to give him some proofs of my love but all my panting and sweating were in vain. He jumped up in a rage and accused my lack of virility and change of heart, declaring that he had for a long time suspected that I had been expending my vigor and breath elsewhere. “No! No! Darling,” I replied, “my love for you has always been the same, but reason prevails now over love and wantonness.”) “And for the Socratic continence of your love, I thank you in his name,” (he replied sarcastically,) “Alcibiades was never more spotless when he left his master’s bed!”<br/>

<p>“Believe me, ‘brother,’ when I tell you that I do not know whether I am a man or not,” (I vainly protested;) “I do not feel like one, if I am! Dead and buried lies that part in which I was once an Achilles!” (Giton, seeing that I was completely enervated, and) fearing that it might give cause for scandal if he were caught in this quiet place with me, tore himself away and fled into an inner part of the house. (He had just gone when) Chrysis entered the room and handed me her mistress’s tablets, in which were written the following words:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>CIRCE TO POLYAENOS--GREETING.</p>
<p>Were I a wanton, I should complain of my disappointment, but as it is I am beholden to your impotence, for by it I dallied the longer in the shadow of pleasure. Still, I would like to know how you are and whether you got home upon your own legs, for the doctors say that one cannot walk without nerves! Young man, I advise you to beware of paralysis for I never in my life saw a patient in such great danger; you’re as good as dead, I’m sure! What if the same numbness should attack your hands and knees? You would have to send for the funeral trumpeters! Still, even if I have been affronted, I will not begrudge a prescription to one as sick as you! Ask Giton if you would like to recover. I am sure you will get back your strength if you will sleep without your “brother” for three nights. So far as I am concerned, I am not in the least alarmed about. finding someone to whom I shall be as pleasing as I was to you; my mirror and my reputation do not lie.</p>
<p>          Farewell (if you can).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>“Such things will happen,” said Chrysis, when she saw that I had read through the entire inditement, “and especially in this city, where the women can lure the moon from the sky! But we’ll find a cure for your trouble. Just return a diplomatic answer to my mistress and restore her self-esteem by frank courtesy for, truth to tell, she has never been herself from the minute she received that affront.” I gladly followed the maid’s advice and wrote upon the tablets as follows:<br/>

<blockquote><div>
<p>POLYAENOS TO CIRCE--GREETING.</p>
<p>Dear lady, I confess that I have often given cause for offense, for I am only a man, and a young one, too, but I never committed a deadly crime until today! You have my confession of guilt, I deserve any punishment you may see fit to prescribe. I betrayed a trust, I murdered a man, I violated a temple: demand my punishment for these crimes. Should it be your pleasure to slay me I will come to you with my sword; if you are content with a flogging I will run naked to my mistress; only bear in mind that it was not myself but my tools that failed me. I was a soldier, and ready, but I had no arms. What threw me into such disorder I do not know, perhaps my imagination outran my lagging body, by aspiring to too much it is likely that I spent my pleasure in delay; I cannot imagine what the trouble was. You bid me beware of paralysis; as if a disease which prevented my enjoying you could grow worse! But my apology amounts briefly to this; if you will grant me an opportunity of repairing my fault, I will give you satisfaction.</p>
<p>          Farewell</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After dismissing Chrysis with these fair promises, I paid careful attention to my body which had so evilly served me and, omitting the bath, I annointed myself, in moderation, with unguents and placed myself upon a more strengthening diet such as onions and snail’s heads without condiments, and I also drank more sparingly of wine; then, taking a short walk before settling down to sleep, I went to bed without Giton. So anxious was I to please her that I feared the outcome if my “brother” lay tickling my side.<br/>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Finding myself vigorous in mind and body when I arose next morning, I went down to the same clump of plane trees, though I dreaded the spot as one of evil omen, and commenced to wait for Chrysis to lead me on my way. I took a short stroll and had just seated myself where I had sat the day before, when she came under the trees, leading a little old woman by the hand. “Well, Mr. Squeamish,” she chirped, when she had greeted me, “have you recovered your appetite?” In the meantime, the old hag:<br/>
A wine-soaked crone with twitching lips<br/></p>
<p>brought out a twisted hank of different colored yarns and put it about my neck; she then kneaded dust and spittle and, dipping her middle finger into the mixture, she crossed my forehead with it, in spite of my protests.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><br/>
As long as life remains, there’s hope;<br/>
Thou rustic God, oh hear our prayer,<br/>
Great Priapus, I thee invoke,<br/>
Temper our arms to dare!</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When she had made an end of this incantation she ordered me to spit three times, and three times to drop stones into my bosom, each stone she wrapped up in purple after she had muttered charms over it; then, directing her hands to my privates, she commenced to try out my virility. Quicker than thought the nerves responded to the summons, filling the crone’s hand with an enormous erection! Skipping for joy, “Look, Chrysis, look,” she cried out, “see what a hare I’ve started, for someone else to course!” (This done, the old lady handed me over to Chrysis, who was greatly delighted at the recovery of her mistress’s treasure; she hastily conducted me straight to the latter, introducing me into a lovely nook that nature had furnished with everything which could delight the eye.)</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><br/>
Shorn of its top, the swaying pine here casts a<br/>
summer shade<br/>
And quivering cypress, and the stately plane<br/>
And berry-laden laurel. A brook’s wimpling waters strayed<br/>
Lashed into foam, but dancing on again<br/>
And rolling pebbles in their chattering flow.<br/>
‘Twas Love’s own nook,<br/>
As forest nightingale and urban Procne undertook<br/>
To bear true witness; hovering, the gleaming grass above<br/>
And tender violets; wooing with song, their stolen love.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Fanning herself with a branch of flowering myrtle, she lay, stretched out with her marble neck resting upon a golden cushion. When she caught sight of me she blushed faintly; she recalled yesterday’s affront, I suppose. At her invitation, I sat down by her side, as soon as the others had gone; whereupon she put the branch of myrtle over my face and emboldened, as if a wall had been raised between us, “Well, Mr. Paralytic,” she teased, “have you brought all of yourself along today?” “Why ask me,” I replied, “why not try me instead?” and throwing myself bodily into her arms, I revelled in her kisses with no witchcraft to stop me.<br/>
