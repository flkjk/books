<blockquote><div>
<p><br/>
Embasicetas fut bientot au comble de ses voeux.<br/>
The Catamite soon reached the height of his passion.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The theologians class this species of lascivious feeling with pollution which is complete when it produces a result. The Holy Scripture tells us of Onan, son of Judas, grandson of Jacob, and husband of Thamar, who was slain by the Lord because he spilled his semen, “he poured his semen upon the ground.” We may be reproached, perhaps, for citing the Holy Bible too frequently, but that book contains the knowledge of salvation, and those who wish to be saved should not fail to study it with assiduity. That this study has occupied a good part of our life, we admit, and we have always found that study profitable. To vigorous minds that admission may seem ridiculous, but we are writing only for pious souls, and they will willingly applaud this courageous profession of our piety.</p>
<p>The theologians have also classified onanism and pollution among the sins against the Holy Ghost, and this being the case, there is no being in the world who has been sinned against so often. A medium indulgence in this sin furnished the pleasure of a queen, the severity of one Lucretia does not repel a thousand Tarquins. Men with vivid imaginations create for themselves a paradise peopled with the most beautiful houris, more seductive than those of Mahomet; Lycoris had a beautiful body but it was unfeeling; the imagination of her lover pictured her as falling before his caresses, he led her by the hand over pressed flowers, through a thick grove and along limpid streams; in that sweet reverie his life slipped by.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><br/>
Here icy cold fountains, here flower covered meadows, Lycoris;<br/>
Here shady groves; life itself here would I dream out with thee.<br/>
               Virgil Bucol. Ecl. X, 41.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the minds of the theologians pollution is synonymous with all pleasures with persons of the opposite or the same sex, which result in a waste of the elixir of life. In this sense, love between woman and woman is pollution and Sappho is a sinner against the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>(Notwithstanding), however (these caprices of the third person of the trinity) I cannot see why pleasure should be regulated, or why a woman who has surveyed all the charms of a young girl of eighteen years should give herself up to the rude embraces of a man. What comparisons can be made between those red lips, that mouth which breathes pleasure for the first time, those snowy and purplous cheeks whose velvet smoothness is like the Venus flower, half in bloom, that new-born flesh which palpitates softly with desire and voluptuousness, that hand which you press so delicately, those round thighs, those plastic buttocks, that voice sweet and touching,--what comparison can be made between all this and pronounced features, rough beard, hard breast, hairy body, and the strong disagreeable voice of man? Juvenal has wonderfully expended all his bile in depicting, as hideous scenes, these mysteries of the Bona Dea, where the young and beautiful Roman women, far from the eyes of men, give themselves up to mutual caresses. Juvenal has painted the eyes of the Graces with colors which are proper to the Furies; his tableau, moreover, revolts one instead of doing good.</p>
<p>The only work of Sappho’s which remains to us is an ode written to one of her loved ones and from it we may judge whether the poetess merited her reputation. It has been translated into all languages; Catullus put it into Latin and Boileau into French. Here follows an imitation of that of Catullus:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><br/>
Peer of a God meseemeth he,<br/>
Nay passing Gods (and that can be!)<br/>
Who all the while sits facing thee<br/>
Sees thee and hears<br/>
Thy low sweet laughs which (ah me!) daze<br/>
Mine every sense, and as I gaze<br/>
Upon thee (Lesbia!) o’er me strays<br/>
<br/>
My tongue is dulled, limbs adown<br/>
Flows subtle flame; with sound its own<br/>
Rings either ear, and o’er are strown<br/>
Mine eyes with night.<br/>
               (LI. Burton, tr.)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After that we should never again exhort the ministers and moralists to inveigh against love of women for women; never was the interest of men found to be so fully in accord with the precepts of divine law.</p>
<p>Here I should like to speak of the brides of the Lord; but I remember “The Nun” of Diderot, and my pen falls from my hand. Oh, who would dare to touch a subject handled by Diderot?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<p><br/></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><br/>

Giton the victor had won a not bloodless victory.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>All people have regarded virginity as something sacred, and God has so honored it that he willed that his son be born of a virgin, fecundated, however, by the Holy Ghost. Still, it appears problematical whether the Virgin Mary, complete virgin that she was, did not have the same pleasure as those who are not virgins, when she received the divine annunciation. Father Sanchez has discussed the question very fully “whether the Virgin Mary ‘spent’ in copulation with the Holy-Ghost,” unhappily, he decided in the negative, and I have too much veneration for Father Sanchez not to submit to his decision; but because of it, I am vexed with the Virgin Mary and the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, the daughters of the people of the Lord were not content to remain virgins; a state of being which, at bottom has not much to recommend it. The daughter of Jephtha before being immolated for the sake of the Lord, demanded of her father a reprieve of two months in which to weep for her virginity upon the mountains of Gelboe; it seems it should not have taken so long had she had nothing to regret. Ruth had recourse to the quickest method when she wished to cease being a virgin; she simply went and lay down upon the bed with Boaz. The spirit of God has deemed it worth while to transmit this story to us, for the instruction of virgins from century to century.</p>
<p>The pagan Gods thought highly of maidenheads, they often took them and always, they set aside the virgins for themselves. The Phtyian, from whose organ Apollo was foreordained to come, proved to be only a virgin; the spirit of God did not communicate itself to anyone who had ever been sullied by contact with a mortal. It was to virgins that the sacred fires of Vesta were entrusted, and the violation of their virginity was a capital crime which all Rome regarded as a scourge from wrathful heaven.</p>
<p>The Sybils lived and died virgins; in addressing the Cumaean Sybil, AEneas never failed to bestow that title upon her.</p>
<p>Most of the immortals have preserved their virginity, Diana, Minerva, et cet. But what is the most astonishing is that the companions of Venus and Amor, the most lovable of all divinities, the Graces, were also virgins. Juno became a virgin again every year, by bathing in the waters of a magic fountain; that must have rendered Jupiter’s duties rather onerous.</p>
<p>There are some reasons for this passion of mankind for maidenheads. It is so wonderful to give the first lessons of voluptuousness to a pure and innocent heart, to feel under one’s hand the first palpitations of the virginal breasts which arouses unknown delights, to dry the first tears of tenderness, to inspire that first mixture of fear and hope, of vague desires and expectant inquietude; whoever has never had that satisfaction has missed the most pleasurable of all the delights of love. But taken in that sense, virginity is rather a moral inclination, as Buffon says, than a physical matter, and nothing can justify the barbarous precautions against amorous theft which were taken by unnatural fathers and jealous husbands.</p>
<p>In those unhappy countries which are bent under oppression, in those countries where heaven shows its heat in the beauty of the sex, and where beauty is only an object of speculation for avid parents; in such countries, I say, they resort to the most odious methods for preserving the virginity of the young and beautiful daughters who are destined to be sold like common cattle. They put a lock over the organ of pleasure and never permit it to be opened except when it is strictly necessary for carrying out those animal functions for which nature destined them.</p>
<p>The locks of chastity were long known in Europe; the Italians are accused with this terrible invention. Nevertheless, it is certain that they were used upon men, at least, in the time of the first Roman emperors. Juvenal, in his satire against women, VI, says: “If the singers please them there is no need for locks of chastity for those who have sold their voices to the praetors, who keep them.”</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><br/>
Si gaudet cantu, nullius fibula durat<br/>
Vocem vendentis praetoribus.<br/>
               Sat. VI, 379.<br/>
<br/>
If pleased by the song of the singer employed by the praetor<br/>
No fibula long will hold out, free, the actor will greet her.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Christianity, most spiritual, most mystical of ancient religions, attempts to make out a great case for celibacy. Its founder never married, although the Pharisees reproached him for frequenting gay women, and had, perhaps, some reason for so doing. Jesus showed a particular affection for Mary Magdalen, to the point of exciting the jealousy of Martha, who complained that her sister passed her time in conversation with Jesus and left her with all the housework to do. “Mary has chosen the better part,” said the Savior. A good Christian must not doubt that the colloquies were always spiritual.</p>
<p>St. Paul counseled virginity and most of the apostolic fathers practiced it. Among others, St. Jerome lived his whole life among women and never lost his purity. He answered his enemies who reproached him with his very great intimacy with the Saintly Sisters, that the irrefutable proof of his chastity was that he stank. That stinking of St. Jerome, which is not a veritable article of faith in the Church, is, however, an object of pious belief; and my readers will very gladly assent to it.</p>
<p>When the Christian clergy wishes to form a body of doctrines to be submitted to by all the common people it thinks that by separating its interests and those of the common people as far as possible it must tighten those ropes by which it binds its fellow citizens. Also the Pope who was the most jealous of ecclesiastical power and the one who abused it most, Hildebrand, rigorously prohibited the marriage of priests and enunciated the most terrible warnings against those who did not retain their celibacy. However, although neither priests nor monks were permitted to marry, the epithet “virgins” cannot be justly applied to all priests and all monks without exception. Nor shall I repeat here the naughty pleasantries of Erasmus, of Boccaccio, and all the others, against the monks; without doubt maliciousness has developed more “satyrical” traits that they have brought out; beyond that, I have nothing to say.<br/>

<blockquote><div>
<p><br/>
Alors une vielle. . . .<br/>
[Finally an old woman . . .]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The question here has to do with a procurers or go-between. That profession has gradually fallen into discredit by I know not what fatality, which befalls the most worthy things. Cervantes the only philosophic author Spain has produced, wanted that calling to be venerated in cities above all others. And truly, when one thinks how much finesse is necessary to pursue that profession with success, when one considers that those who practice that truly liberal art are the repositories of the most important as well as the most sacred secrets, one would never fail to have the greatest respect for them. The tranquillity of homes, the civil state of persons they hold at their discretion, and still, though they drink in insults, though they endure abuse, very rarely do these beings, true stoics, compromise those who have confided in them.</p>
<p>In their Mercury, the ancients realized their beau ideal or archetype of go-between which they called; in vulgar language “pimp”. That God, as go-between for Jupiter, was often involved in the most hazardous enterprises, such as abducting Io, who was guarded by Argus of the hundred eyes; Mercury I say, was the God of concord, or eloquence, and of mystery. Except to inspire them with friendly feeling and kind affections, Mercury never went among mortals. Touched by his wand, venomous serpents closely embraced him. Listening to him, Achilles forgot his pride, extended hospitality to Priam and permitted him to take away the body of Hector. The ferocious Carthaginians were softened through the influence of this God of peace, and received the Trojans in friendship. Mercury it was who gathered men into society and substituted social customs for barbarism. He invented the lyre and was the master of Amphion, who opened the walls of Thebes by the charm of his singing. Mercury or Hermes gave the first man knowledge; but it was enveloped in a mysterious veil which it was never permitted the profane to penetrate, which signifies that all that he learned from God, concerning amorous adventures, should be wrapped in profound silence. How beautiful all these allegories are! And how true! How insipid life would be without these mysterious liaisons, by which Nature carries out her designs, eluding the social ties, without breaking them! Disciples of Mercury, I salute you, whatever be your sex; to your discretion, to your persuasive arts are confided our dearest interests, the peace of mind of husbands, the happiness of lovers, the reputation of women, the legitimacy of children. Without you, this desolated earth would prove to be, in reality, a vale of tears; the young and beautiful wife united to decrepit husband, would languish and grow weak, like the lonely flower which the sun’s rays never touch. Thus did Mexence bind in thine indissoluble bands the living and the dead.</p>
<p>Fate, however, has often avenged the go-betweens on account of the misunderstandings from which they suffer at the hands of the vulgar. Otho opened the way to the empire of the world by his services as a go-between for Nero. And the go-betweens of princes, and even of princesses, are always found in the finest situations. Even Otho did not lose all his rights; Nero exiled him with a commission of honor, “because he was caught in adultery with his own wife, Poppaea.” “Uxoris moechus coeperate esse suae” (Suet. Otho, chap. 111), said malicious gossip at Rome.<br/></p>

<br/>1.F.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
<br/>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
<br/>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
<br/>“Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
<br/>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
<br/>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
<br/>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
<br/>your equipment.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
<br/>of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

<br/>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
<br/>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
<br/>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
<br/>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
<br/>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
<br/>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
<br/>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further

<br/>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance

<br/>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
<br/>that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
<br/>or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
<br/>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
<br/>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
<br/>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
<br/>people in all walks of life.
<br/>
<br/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
<br/>assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
<br/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
<br/>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
<br/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
<br/>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
<br/>and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

<br/>
<br/>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
<br/>Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
<br/>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
<br/>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
<br/>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
<br/>array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
<br/>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
<br/>status with the IRS.
<br/>
<br/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
<br/>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
<br/>States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
<br/>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
<br/>with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
<br/>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<br/>SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
<br/>particular state visit https://pglaf.org
<br/>
<br/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
<br/>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
<br/>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
<br/>approach us with offers to donate.
<br/>
<br/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
<br/>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
<br/>outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
<br/>
<br/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
<br/>methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
<br/>ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
<br/>donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate

<br/>
<br/>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works.
<br/>
<br/>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
<br/>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
<br/>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
<br/>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
<br/>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
<br/>
<br/>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook’s
<br/>eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
<br/>compressed (zipped), HTML and others.
<br/>
<br/>Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
<br/>the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
<br/>VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
<br/>new filenames and etext numbers.
<br/>
<br/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<br/>
<br/>     https://www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
<br/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
<br/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
<br/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
<br/>
<br/>EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
<br/>are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
<br/>download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
<br/>search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
<br/>download by the etext year.
<br/>
<br/>     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06
<br/>
<br/>    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
<br/>     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)
<br/>
<br/>EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
<br/>filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
<br/>of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
<br/>identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
<br/>digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
<br/>example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:
<br/>
<br/>     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234
<br/>
<br/>or filename 24689 would be found at:
<br/>     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
<br/>
