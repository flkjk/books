Unfortunately, the very visit designed to help her brother introduces her to Count Alexei Vronsky and sets in motion a chain of events that will ripple through families and the unforgiving society of wealthy Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\nInitially serialized over five years in The Russian Messenger, Anna Karenina was first published as a two-volume novel in 1878. It was Leo Tolstoy\u2019s second novel, coming after War and Peace and further cementing his role as the primary Russian author of his age. Tolstoy drew on his aristocratic upbringing to set the scene for the novel, and it\u2019s widely believed that he wrote his own experiences and struggles with religion (documented in A Confession) into the central character of Konstantin Levin. \u2014 Standard Ebooks",

Through a series of accidents of fate and wilful misunderstandings the Karamazovs edge closer to tragedy, while the local townspeople watch on.\n\nThe Brothers Karamazov was Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s final novel, and was originally serialised in The Russian Messenger before being published as a complete novel in 1880. This edition is the well-received 1912 English translation by Constance Garnett. As well as earning wide-spread critical acclaim, the novel has been widely influential in literary and philosophical circles; Franz Kafka and James Joyce admired the emotions that verge on madness in the Karamazovs, while Sigmund Freud and Jean-Paul Satre found inspiration in the themes of patricide and existentialism. \u2014 Standard Ebooks",

The novel was first serialized in The Russian Messenger over the course of 1866, where it was an instant success. It was published in a single volume in 1867.

Its unusual verse structure combined with Pushkin\u2019s own commentary on the social canvas of the time has meant that it has remained relevant and read to this day.

Tolstoy himself refused to call it that, saying it was \u201cnot a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle.\u201d It contains elements of history, narrative, and philosophy, the latter increasing in quantity as the book moves towards its climax.
